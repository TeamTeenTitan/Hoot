                "body": "Paris — French voters reelected President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday night, granting him a second term with a substantial victory over his far right-wing opponent Marine Le Pen. CBS News correspondent Elaine Cobbe reports that many had expected the weekend runoff election results to be very close, but even with his clear win, Macron likely won't rest easy for long.\n\nThe significance of France's national election goes far beyond the country's own borders, and Cobbe says there were sighs of relief across much of France and far beyond as Macron's victory quashed the chances of an extremist president — hostile to the European Union and NATO, and with reportedly close ties to Russia — taking office, at least for another five years.\n\nPresident Macron's supporters partied until late into the evening under the Eiffel Tower, celebrating his decisive win with more than 58% of the vote against Le Pen's 41%.\n\nSupporters react after the victory of French President Emmanuel Macron in France's presidential election at the Champ de Mars in Paris on April 24, 2022. BERTRAND GUAY/AFP/Getty\n\n\"We stood up against nationalism, we tried to show that today, we have to be more united than ever,\" said one reveler.\n\nBut carrying more than 40% of the electorate, it was the closest the far-right has come to taking the top seat in any French election, so Macron's celebration will be short-lived. The election has shown just how deeply divided France is right now — a reality the president acknowledged in his victory speech.\n\n\"We need to be respectful,\" he said. \"Our country is full of so many divisions, so we need to be strong, but no one will be left behind.\"\n\nHe'll have a tough job uniting the French behind him. The results indicate that extremist voters far outnumbered those from the center, or the traditional left and right parties.\n\nFrance's far-right party leader Marine Le Pen makes a statement after the results of the votes in the second round of France's presidential election, at Pavillon d'Armenonvillea, April 24, 2022 in Paris, France. French President Emmanuel Macron defeated Marine Le Pen in the final round of France's presidential election. Chesnot/Getty\n\nAfter the results were announced, there were protests in several cities against both candidates. Fireworks were launched at police and tear gas was used to clear crowds.\n\nOne banner derided Macron as \"the Robin Hood of the RICH.\"\n\nLe Pen echoed that sentiment in her own speech, accepting defeat but urging her supporters to keep fighting \"this hoarding of power by a few,\" and vowing to continue her \"commitment to France.\"\n\nIn an increasingly fractured France, Le Pen vowed to fight on.\n\nCongratulations to @EmmanuelMacron on his re-election. France is our oldest ally and a key partner in addressing global challenges. I look forward to our continued close cooperation — including on supporting Ukraine, defending democracy, and countering climate change. — President Biden (@POTUS) April 24, 2022\n\nCongratulations for Macron have poured in from around the world, including from President Biden, who said he looked \"forward to our continued close cooperation — including on supporting Ukraine, defending democracy, and countering climate change.\"\n\nGermany's chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were among the many other leaders to convey their well-wishes to Macron. They're relieved that France will continue to play a strong role in international diplomacy, but Macron's real fight now will be at home.",

On Sunday he commanded global attention again in a meeting in Kyiv with two top American officials, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, who pledged more military support and — in a move of symbolic importance — said the United States would move to reopen its embassy in Kyiv.\n\nBut behind the scenes, Mr. Zelensky’s success so far is also rooted in the government’s ability to operate smoothly and take measures to help people cope, such as sweeping deregulation to keep the economy afloat, and to provide essential goods and services.\n\nBy loosening rules around transporting cargo, for instance, the government was able to address a dire risk of food shortages in Kyiv, the capital, in the early days of the war. And in March he dropped business taxes to 2 percent — and then only if the owner wanted to pay.\n\n“Pay if you can but if you cannot there are no questions asked,” Mr. Zelensky said at the time.\n\nMore contentiously, he combined six television stations that previously competed against one another into one outlet for news. The merger, he said, was necessary for national security, but it frustrated political opponents and free speech advocates.",

An operating manual for the Orlando FreeFall ride says the maximum passenger weight is just over 286 pounds. Sampson, who lived in Missouri, was 6 feet, 5 inches tall and reportedly weighed 360 pounds.\n\nKen Martin, an amusement park ride safety analyst and consultant, told Fox News Digital he believes the Orlando FreeFall incident is \"criminal,\" and says \"somebody killed Mr. Tyre Sampson.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. With all these circumstances, all these incidents that occurred, it's criminal. Somebody killed Mr. Tyre Sampson,\" Martin said.\n\nORLANDO FREEFALL: FLORIDA LAWMAKER CALLS FOR 'LOOPHOLE' IN LAW TO BE CLOSED AFTER TEENAGER DIED ON RIDE\n\nThe Orlando FreeFall drop tower at ICON Park in Orlando, Fla., March 28, 2022. Tyre Sampson, 14, was killed when he fell from the ride. Orlando Sentinel via Getty\n\nMartin suggets a grand jury be formed with input from people within the industry, saying that somebody should be charged for Sampson's death. Martin said the ride's operator should have seen that the shoulder harness was not in the right spot, adding that \"multiple causes\" led to the incident.\n\n\"Once Mr. Sampson got on the ride, the ride operator should have come around, attempted to pull the shoulder harness over him and lock it,\" Martin said. \"We all saw that. We know that the shoulder restraint did not come down where it was supposed to be and that, you know, is an issue.\"\n\nORLANDO FREEFALL: FLORIDA LAW 'LOOPHOLE' MAY HAVE LEFT TEEN RIDER IN DEATH TRAP: EXPERT\n\nAn accident report filled out by an employee states that the seat harness was in a locked position after Tyre fell out.\n\n\"FreeFall was coming … down the tower. When the magnets engaged, the patron came out of the seat,\" an employee wrote in the report. \"Harness was still in a down and locked position when the ride stopped.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMartin said that a uniform code for amusement parks is needed, specifically for signage alerting passengers of limitations and safety requirements for a specific ride before entering.\n\nCurrent Florida law allows a manufacturer to decide what goes in — and what stays out — of passenger limitation signs.\n\nFLORIDA FREEFALL TRAGEDY: STATE AGENCY HIRES FORENSIC ENGINEER TO INVESTIGATE TEEN'S AMUSEMENT PARK DEATH\n\nThe Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services released its commissioned engineering report performed by Quest Engineering last week, which states that a \"proximity sensor\" for the harness being used by Sampson was \"manually loosened,\" meaning Sampson wasn't properly secured in his seat.\n\nNikki Fried, Florida commissioner of agriculture and consumer services, said during a press conference last week that \"maladjustments\" were made to the seat's proximity sensor that allowed a safety light to illuminate, allowing Sampson to ride even though he was not \"properly secured in the seat.\"\n\n\"These maladjustments allowed the safety lights to illuminate – improperly satisfying the ride's electronic safety mechanisms — that allowed the ride to operate even though Mr. Sampson was not properly secured in the seat,\" Fried said. \"The report confirms that manual adjustments had been made to the sensor for the seat in question that allowed the harness' restraint opening to be almost double that of the normal restraints opening range.\"\n\nFLORIDA FREEFALL TRAGEDY: AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE AT CENTER OF TEEN'S DEADLY FALL WAS BUILT IN DECEMBER\n\nSamson's harness had a proximity sensor that \"was manually loosened, adjusted and tightened to allow a restraint opening of near seven inches,\" according to the report.\n\nNormally, the range is around three inches, according to the report.\n\n\"Orlando Slingshot has fully cooperated with the state during the initial phase of its investigation, and we will continue to do so until it has officially concluded,\" Trevor Arnold, an attorney representing operator Orlando Slingshot, said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"All protocols, procedures and safety measures provided to us by the manufacturer of the ride were followed. Today’s report suggests a full review of the ride’s design, safety, operation, restraint mechanisms and history – which, of course, we welcome. We look forward to working with the Florida legislature to implement change in the industry, as the safety of our patrons is always our top priority.\"\n\nFLORIDA FREEFALL TEEN DEATH: RIDE SAFETY EXPERT HARNESS 'WAS NOT ON CORRECTLY '\n\nThe ride has been closed since Sampson's death March 24. Depending on the outcome of the department's investigation, it could be closed for good, Fried said during a previous press conference.\n\nFox News' Jon Brown contributed to this report.",

He is shown in his limousine. Bettmann via Getty Images\n\nJapan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia's invasion despite the \"completely inappropriate\" portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.\n\nThe video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia's invasion as \"rashism.\" Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words \"Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.\"\n\nJapan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito, who was revered as a god until he renounced his divinity after Japan's defeat. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided. He is known posthumously in Japan as Emperor Showa.\n\n\"Portraying Hitler, Mussolini and Emperor Showa in the same context is completely inappropriate,\" Isozaki told reporters. \"It was extremely regrettable.\"\n\nIsozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of the emperor's image, which Ukraine has done.\n\n\"Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,\" the Ukrainian government tweeted Sunday. \"We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.\"\n\nUkraine Ambassador to Japan Sergiy Korsunsky also apologized in a tweet Monday, saying the creator of the video lacked an understanding of history.\n\nHirohito's son, former Emperor Akihito, devoted his reign to atoning for the impact of the war in and outside Japan.\n\nThe video has been replaced with one without Hirohito's photo, but many Japanese on social media continued to criticize the original as an insult and said Japan should stop supporting Ukraine. Others said Hideki Tojo, the Japanese wartime prime minister who was later convicted of war crimes and hanged, would have been a better choice than Hirohito for the video.\n\nSome, however, raised concern that Japan's demand that the video be revised was censorship and said Ukraine's concession set a bad precedent that would embolden Japanese conservatives to further rewrite Japan's wartime history.\n\nJapan has worried that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could have an impact in East Asia, where China's military has grown increasingly assertive and has threatened to unite with Chinese-claimed Taiwan by force if necessary. Japan has tried to play a greater role as part of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in response to the invasion, joining a series of sanctions against Moscow and providing support for Ukraine in line with other members.\n\nJapan provided $300 million for Ukraine and neighboring countries that have accepted displaced Ukrainians, and has also accepted hundreds of evacuees since Russia's invasion in late February.",

I think it was probably a Ukrainian attack, but we cannot be certain,” Lee said.\n\n“The fact that it was two separate sites not far from the border is important,” Lee said, adding that the fires may have been caused by a Tochka-U tactical ballistic missile, which he said had the range to reach both targets if deployed near the Russian-Ukrainian border.\n\nLee added that if Ukrainian involvement was confirmed, the strikes were likely to have been conducted to “disrupt fuel supplies for the Russian military”.\n\nIn a statement on its website, the Russian emergency ministry only mentioned one of the fires, saying that a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 2am local time caught fire and there had been no need to evacuate any parts of the city of 400,000 people.\n\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am\n\nRussia’s investigative committee said in a separate statement that it had ordered an investigation into the incident. Ukrainian officials have so far not commented on the fire.\n\nSeveral videos posted on social media on Monday morning appeared to show the moment of the explosion at one of the oil depots in Bryansk.\n\nAccording to Baza, a Telegram news channel with links to Russian security services, the fires were caused by Ukrainian drones.\n\nRussia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of launching strikes on its territory.\n\nLast week, Moscow blamed Ukrainian helicopters for hitting residential buildings and injuring seven people in Bryansk. At the beginning of April, the governor of the Belgorod region, which is also close to the Ukraine border, said that two Kyiv helicopters had fired at a fuel depot there, claims Ukraine has denied. The Russian defence ministry has promised to bomb targets in Kyiv in response to what it said were “terrorist and sabotage” attacks on its territory carried out by Ukraine’s “nationalist regime”.\n\nRussia has suffered a series of major fires at state facilities across the country in recent weeks.\n\nOn Friday, 17 people were killed after a huge fire broke out at a key Russian defence research institute in Tver, north-west of Moscow. On the same day, a major chemical plant not far from Moscow caught fire. Russia, where accidental fires are common due to dilapidated infrastructure, has blamed the fire in Tver on ageing wiring.",

Ballot-counting starts on 2 May.\n\nAmazon has aggressively opposed unionization among its workforce, which totals about 1.1 million people in the US alone. The fight comes as workers at other major corporations including Starbucks are fighting to unionize.\n\nAmazon has spent millions hiring union avoidance consultants. Amazon Labor Union (ALU) organizers have alleged harassment and intimidation from management.\n\nThe company is vigorously contesting its first loss and has accused ALU of using “objectionable, coercive, and misleading behavior”, to convince workers to support them. Among other objections, Amazon claims the vote should be overturned because ALU “intentionally created hostile confrontations” and offered marijuana to workers in an “impermissible grant of support” for workers’ votes, according to filings obtained by the New York Times.\n\nThe sorting center is right across the street from the JFK8 warehouse where workers won a historic first union election at Amazon in the US on 1 April.\n\nIt is the second union election petition filed by the ALU, an independent group of current and former Amazon workers with no affiliation with established labor unions and led by the former Amazon worker Chris Smalls.\n\nVoting Tents going ‼️⬆️ up We’re ready to make history again LDJ5 will be the 1st sortation center in the country to unionize @amazonlabor #ALU #ALUfortheWin ✊🏽 pic.twitter.com/rcRq9KsaLb — Christian Smalls (@Shut_downAmazon) April 18, 2022\n\nSince the union’s election win at JFK8, ALU has received inquiries from workers at dozens of Amazon facilities around the US and internationally about forming unions at their respective facilities and received over $300,000 in donations to the union’s GoFundMe page.\n\nAhead of the election, ALU hosted a rally featuring speeches from Senator Bernie Sanders and union leaders, including the AFA-CWA international president, Sara Nelson, and Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union.\n\nALU organizers who work at LDJ5 have said they experienced similar anti-union efforts by Amazon, and have filed multiple unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board.\n\n“This employer has been engaging in sustained unlawful union busting. Amazon has violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by forcing employees to attend captive audience meetings, disciplining organizers for protected union activities, and prohibiting the union from displaying its banner in the break rooms,” said Seth Goldstein, a pro bono attorney representing the ALU.\n\nThe union has joined with the American Federation of Teachers and New York State United Teachers in filing a complaint with the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, alleging that Amazon’s anti-union efforts are in violation of the provisions of the New York state Excelsior Jobs Program, and pushing for Amazon to pay back $400m in tax breaks they received through the program.",

The watch was apparently abandoned at a U.S. restaurant for weeks.\n\nThe images show what appears to be a device with a circular watch face and two buttons surrounding a rotating physical crown. A small pinpoint sized hole, possibly used as a microphone or sensor, sits between the crown and one of the buttons. The bottom of the device meanwhile features what appears to be more sensors. The leaker claims the device “looks metallic but feels like it’s coated with glass.”\n\nAs far as dimensions go, a Redditor going by the handle tagtech414, who claims to be the same leaker who spoke to Android Central, says the device is roughly 0.5 inches thick and 1.5 inches in diameter, and about the same size as a Galaxy Watch 46mm. T agtech414 posted an image in an effort to verify his identity as the person who shared the images with Android Central.\n\nThough there’s no way to confidently guess an actual price point with the images provided, the device apparently didn’t feel cheap. In his Reddit post, the supposed leaker claimed the device had an Apple Watch style premium feeling to it. In addition to the device itself, the images also show a blue watch strap reminiscent of the Apple Watch’s athletics straps. By and large, the leaked images match up with previously leaked rendered images.\n\nAnyone looking for more details on the software side of things will have to wait, though. The supposed leaker claims he tried to turn on the device but wasn’t able to get past this gray Google icon featured below. Android Central notes this could mean the purported device doesn’t actually have an operating system on it. A charger wasn’t left with the device, but Android Central notes the device could be charged within its case like an Apple Watch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment on the device’s authenticity, though it’s worth noting this actually wouldn’t be the first time a Big Tech employee abandoned a key piece of prototype hardware. Back in 2010, Gizmodo discovered a then unreleased iPhone 4 left in a bar in Redwood City. There’s also a non-zero possibility Google intended for the device to make its way into the wild as a type of marketing stunt.\n\nThe supposed leaker revealed some more interesting details on how he came to obtain the device on his Reddit Ask Me Anything post. In his post, tagtech414 said the device was first discovered by his friend who works as a bartender at a restaurant. The restaurant supposedly held on to the device for several weeks, expecting its owner to return for it but clearly they never did. Tagtech414 says t he device’s strap, which was photographed separately from the device, was packaged separately from the device itself. Maybe most importantly, he tried to assure readers he’s not an undercover Google employee trying to rev up the Google Pixel hype train.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“No, I don’t work for Google or any subsidiaries, and nobody is paying me to do this,” the Reddit user wrote. “Google, if you’re reading this...I have a wedding coming up and a very large guest list. Feel free to listen to the masses and drop some of that alphabet moola on me :)”",

But exactly what happened to them remains a mystery.\n\nWhat was originally a missing persons investigation is now a hunt for a killer after a husband and wife were found shot to death in the woods Thursday.\n\nThe office of Attorney General John Formella said early Friday that two suspicious deaths were under investigation, later identifying the victims as 67-year-old Stephen Reid and 66-year-old Djeswende Reid.\n\nPolice said the husband and wife were avid outdoors people, known to take frequent walks along the trails near their home.\n\nStay informed about local news and weather. Get the NBC10 Boston app for iOS or Android and pick your alerts.\n\nTimeline of events\n\nThe Reids left their home in an apartment complex Monday afternoon and went for a walk that led them to the area of the Broken Ground Trails, officials said.\n\nWhen Stephen Reid didn't show up for a planned event Wednesday, a family member called police to report the couple missing.\n\nAfter an intense search, investigators found their bodies Thursday evening in a wooded area near the Marsh Loop Trail, near the Broken Ground Trails off Portsmouth Street, authorities said. There was still a heavy law enforcement presence combing the area Friday afternoon.\n\n\"This is a tragedy, and it's something that came out of nowhere, and we're doing our due diligence, investing all of our resources, working with our state and local partners, to bring this case to a successful resolution,\" Concord Police Chief Bradley Osgood said.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Geoffrey Ward said the Reids left their apartment at the Alton Woods complex on Loudon Road around 2:20 p.m. Monday. They walked along Portsmouth Road to the Broken Ground Trails, and their family and friends never saw or heard from them again.\n\nAutopsy results released\n\nThe autopsies were conducted by Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Mitchell Weinberg, the attorney general's office said. He determined that the cause of Stephen Reid’s death was multiple gunshot wounds, and that the manner of his death was homicide. He determined that the cause of Djeswende Reid’s death was also multiple gunshot wounds, and that the manner of her death was homicide.\n\nNo arrests have been made.\n\nThe New Hampshire Attorney General's Office is investigating the shooting deaths of 67-year-old Stephen Reid and 66-year-old Djeswende Reid.\n\n'Lock your doors and be vigilant'\n\nThose who live nearby say they are surprised they didn't hear any gunshots.\n\n\"It's strange. This is a very peaceful neighborhood and they're talking about murder,\" Doug Ponusky said. \"I never lock my doors. I think I'm gonna lock them tonight.\"\n\nAt a press conference, Ward and Osgood declined to speculate on whether the shooting was believed to be random. Asked if he would recommend that residents lock their doors, Osgood said, \"it's always smart to lock your doors and be vigilant.\"\n\nAt the same time, however, authorities said in a press release that residents \"are encouraged to be vigilant and take normal precautions as they go about their daily lives.\"\n\nInvestigators seek public's help\n\nInvestigators are now asking for the public's help in locating the killer.\n\n\"Anyone who saw the Reids that Monday afternoon, anyone walking on those trails, anyone who has any information related to their disappearance or deaths are asked to contact the Concord Police Department about anything that they saw or heard that afternoon,\" Ward said.\n\n“In addition, anyone along the area where the Reids walked that day from Alton Woods to Portsmouth Street to the Broken Ground Trails who has a home or business security system is asked to review their recordings to determine if the Reids or anyone else were captured on those videos,\" he added.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call the Concord Police Department at 603-225-8600. Tips can also be left anonymously by calling 603-226-3100.",

United says its no-fly list of nearly 1,000 passengers will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and that only customers who “commit to follow all crew member instructions on board” will have their travel ban’s lifted.\n\nLike both Alaska and Delta, passengers who “demonstrated egregious behavior” will remain on United’s no-fly list but flight attendants at the Chicago-based carrier say the airline has jumped the gun. United announced its plan to lift travel restrictions on anti-maskers within days of the federal face mask mandate being struck down by a Florida judge.\n\n“The airlines need to slow down and consider all potential consequences of any policy changes,” commented Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) which not only represents United’s flight attendants but those at Alaska and 15 other carriers including Frontier and Spirit. The union is also pushing to unionise Delta’s crew members.\n\n“Not one banned passenger should be allowed back until there is a thorough discussion with unions, public health officials, and other stakeholders.” Nelson told U.S. media late last week. She has described the rush to rescind travel bans as “outrageous”.\n\n“While the mask mandate is over, bringing formerly banned passengers back within 24 hours of lifting the mandate is no way to support Flight Attendants who are charged with the safety of the passengers in our care while ensuring confidence in our industry,” said the local union which represents United’s flight attendants.\n\n“It is our view that this announcement is premature and without proper context for front line employees,” the union said.\n\nNot that the decision came as much as a surprise to flight attendants. They admit that non-violent anti-maskers were going to be allowed to return to the skies at some point. After all, airlines were open from the start that banned passengers would be allowed to return once face mask rules were relaxed.\n\nBut United’s flight attendants say the speed with which the no-fly list is being dismantled is too fast and airlines have not yet been able to say what would happen if face mask rules were introduced once more.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has formally asked the Department of Justice to appeal the decision to have the mask mandate vacated. The CDC says masking on airplanes “remains necessary for the public health” despite a rush by airlines, including United, to lift mask rules within hours of the court ruling.\n\nThe U.S. airline industry has petitioned the CDC and White House officials over the last couple months in an effort to permanently dismantle masking rules on public transport but the Biden administration continues to insist that the federal face mask mandate is legal and necessary.",

(AP Photo/Alastair Grant, File)\n\nLONDON (AP) — Women from across British politics called Monday for action to tackle misogyny after a newspaper ran a story accusing the deputy opposition leader of trying to “distract” the prime minister during debates by crossing and uncrossing her legs.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday quoted an anonymous Conservative lawmaker as saying Labour Party Deputy Leader Angela Rayner tried to throw Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson “off his stride” as she sat across from him in the House of Commons. The article called it “a fully-clothed Parliamentary equivalent of Sharon Stone’s infamous scene in the 1992 film ‘Basic Instinct,’” in which Stone distracts police interrogators while wearing a short skirt.\n\nRayner accused “Boris Johnson’s cheerleaders” of using “desperate, perverted smears.”\n\n“I stand accused of a ‘ploy’ to “distract” the helpless PM - by being a woman, having legs and wearing clothes,” she wrote on Twitter. “Women in politics face sexism and misogyny every day — and I’m no different.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRayner, who comes from a working-class family in northern England, left school when she was 16 and got her political start in the trade union movement. That makes a sharp contrast with Johnson, who was educated at the elite private school Eton and Oxford University. Johnson has sometimes struggled to parry her attacks during debates.\n\nThe prime minister condemned the article, writing on Twitter: “As much as I disagree with Angela Rayner on almost every political issue, I respect her as a parliamentarian and deplore the misogyny directed at her anonymously today.”\n\nJohnson said Monday he had gotten in touch with Rayner about the article, which he called “the most appalling load of sexist, misogynist tripe.”\n\nHe said the anonymous lawmaker who made the “Basic Instinct” comments would face “the terrors of the Earth” if identified.\n\n“It’s totally intolerable, that kind of thing,” Johnson told British broadcasters.\n\nMore than a century after the first female lawmaker was elected to Britain’s Parliament, women make up 34% of the 650 legislators in the House of Commons. Long known for its boozy, macho atmosphere, Parliament is now a more diverse place.\n\nStill, some say change has not gone far enough. Many female U.K. politicians said the article was an extreme example of the sexism they encounter daily.\n\nLabour legislator Rachel Reeves said she hoped the article would prompt people to “call out this misogyny and sexism for what it is (so) that we get some change, because Angela and no other MP should have to put up with this sort of rubbish.”\n\nSenior Conservatives also condemned the remarks. Health Secretary Sajid Javid tweeted: “No woman in politics should have to put up with this.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nConservative lawmaker Caroline Nokes, who heads Parliament’s Women and Equalities Committee, said she had asked the Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, to censure Glen Owen, the journalist who wrote the article.\n\nHoyle said he had summoned the paper’s editor to discuss the article.\n\nHoyle told lawmakers that media freedom was “one of the building blocks of our democracy,” but that publishing such “misogynistic and offensive” comments “can only deter women who might be considering standing for election, to the detriment of us all.”\n\nAssociated Newspapers, which publishes The Mail on Sunday, declined to comment on the topic.",

Alongside the announcement, the studio revealed a host of changes for the PC version, such as controller support, UI scaling, and cross-progression. But it also revealed why the PC edition of Diablo Immortal exists: to combat emulation.\n\nIn a blog post, Blizzard speaks a bit about going back and forth on wanting Diablo Immortal on PC at all. “On one hand, we felt that we wouldn’t be doing the title justice by releasing a game originally designed for mobile on PC,” Blizzard said, “on the other hand, we wanted to make sure the game reached as many players as possible—especially our most dedicated PC fans.” But, Blizzard explained, “the deciding factor was that we knew many of you would attempt to play this game through an emulator, thus leading us towards building a better experience.”\n\nNot only should this lead to a more curated experience — with UI and controls specifically tailored for PC — but players won’t need to circumvent the studio just to get their pre-Diablo 4 fix. It’s a Blizzard that clearly learned from the fan-made “Classic” World of Warcraft servers of many years ago, which led it to create World of Warcraft: Classic internally.\n\nBlizzard’s candid answer about emulation is a far cry from the oft-memed “Do you guys not have phones?” from Immortal’s 2018 reveal. And with the studio's extended apology at the start of its reveal stream for World of Warcraft: Dragonflight last week, we’re trending toward a more open Blizzard than we’ve seen in some time.\n\nUntil players get their hands on Diablo Immortal (especially the new PC beta), it’s impossible to say how Diablo’s latest title will land with hardcore fans. But if 2018’s Diablo Immortal BlizzCon announcement was the height of Blizzard hubris, Monday’s announcement may give players faith that — at least in terms of game development — that Blizzard is listening again.",

It looks like the specific node has been revealed by Moore's Law is Dead in a recent tweet. As per the latest rumor, the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPUs will be based on the TSMC 4N process node.\n\nMaxon Brings Redshift Render Engine Support For AMD Radeon PRO Graphics Cards\n\nNotice I didn't mention PCIe 5.0 in my Lovelace Slides: https://t.co/n7sdIL1Uku Speaking of \"4\", #NVIDIA Lovelace is indeed 4nm! 🤠🎉😋 More to say on the next Broken Silicon... https://t.co/jjJ1GSod0j — Moore's Law Is Dead (@mooreslawisdead) April 24, 2022\n\nYep, that's the same TSMC 4N process node that powers the Hopper GPUs for the data center HPC market. As for what we know about the TSMC 4N process node, it is a revision of their 5nm process (not to be confused with 4nm/N4 which is a completely different node). The TSMC 4N process node is custom-designed exclusively for NVIDIA and hosts a range of optimizations that allows for better power efficiency, performance, and a minor boost to density versus the vanilla TSMC 5nm node.\n\nThe reasons why NVIDIA may have selected TSMC's 4N as the candidate for its next-gen gaming GPU lineup are kind of obvious. The upcoming cards will be real power-hungry and NVIDIA & the company is going to optimize them as much as they can by utilizing the 4N process node. AMD on the other hand will be utilizing a mix of TSMC 5nm and 6nm process nodes for its upcoming MCM and monolithic GPUs based on the RDNA 3 graphics architecture and while they don't bring the optimizations that 4N does, they will feature an MCM approach that is expected to be highly efficient.\n\nSo at the end of the day, NVIDIA gets the better node while AMD delivers a better design approach. At the end of the day, these won't matter much to end-users who only want to play their games on the best possible hardware (graphics cards) they could get their hands on.\n\nNVIDIA CUDA GPU (RUMORED) Preliminary:",

More recently, during the Meet The Experts webinar, AMD's representatives confirmed that Raphael, codename for Ryzen 7000 CPUs based on Zen 4 core architecture, will be their first DDR5 gaming platform. As such, users running DDR4 memory will have to say goodbye when moving to the new platform.\n\nNVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPUs To Have A Node Advantage Over AMD RDNA 3, Rumored To Utilize TSMC 4N Process\n\nIn the same report by Tomshardware which talked about the X670 chipset being a dual-chiplet design, the tech outlet states that AMD's X670 and B650 chipset powered motherboards will be DDR5-Only. Now while there might be some speculation that a lower-tier A620 chipset allows DDR4 support, that won't be the case since the leaked AM5 feature compatibility list confirms that the socket will only be compliant with DDR5 memory and there's no mention of DDR4 memory.\n\nEditor from @ComputerBase posted this already few days ago in their forum. Socket AM5 guide, in the 254-page document you can find the text \"DDR5\" 76 times, \"DDR4\" never. Some hoped that AMD would support DDR4 on AM5. https://t.co/kO5zfGhnix pic.twitter.com/MQPBr9ocgU — CapFrameX (@CapFrameX) April 25, 2022\n\nBut considering that AMD is moving to DDR5 in the second half of 2022, it's good news for those who are looking forward to upgrading as DDR5 prices continue to fall & availability is just so much better than what it was a few months back during Intel's 12th Gen Alder Lake launch. However, the blue team is providing their users with the options to select between both DDR5 and DDR4 choices. AMD might be in a difficult position as they won't have a higher-end option that comes with DDR4 memory support and users will have to pay much higher prices to hop onboard the new standard.\n\nBesides the DDR5-Only approach, AMD's AM5 platform for Ryzen 7000 CPUs is also expected to come with a host of new technologies. One of these technologies has been detailed by Videocardz. Known as EXPO or Extended Profiles For Overclocking, this new feature will allow AM5 boards to store two memory overclocking profiles which include:\n\nAMD’s High-End X670 Chipset For AM5 Motherboards To Feature Dual-Chiplet Design\n\nAn optimized profile for high-bandwidth (Higher Frequency)\n\nAn optimized profile for low-latency (Tighter CAS Timings)\n\nAMD EXPO will be able to work with UDIMM, RDIMM, and SO-DIMM which opens up the tech for use in mobile platforms too. Now what isn't known is whether this technology replaces RAMP (Ryzen Accelerated Memory Profile) which was previously said to be coming to the new AMD CPU platforms or if it is an extension of that.\n\nOur first DDR5 platform for gaming is our Raphael platform and one of the awesome things about Raphael is that we are really gonna try to make a big splash with overclocking and I'll just kinda leave it there but speeds that you maybe thought couldn't be possible, maybe possible with this overclocking spec. Joseph Tao, Memory Enabling Manager at AMD\n\nThe trademark does reveal that it was filed very recently (February) so it looks like the red team would just end up using this name. Certain monitoring & statistics software have already added preliminary support for RAMP so they might need to update them if AMD switches over to the new EXPO branding.\n\nAMD Mainstream Desktop CPU Generations Comparison:\n\nAMD CPU Family Codename Processor Process Processors Cores/Threads (Max) TDPs Platform Platform Chipset Memory Support PCIe Support Launch Ryzen 1000 Summit Ridge 14nm (Zen 1) 8/16 95W AM4 300-Series DDR4-2677 Gen 3.0 2017 Ryzen 2000 Pinnacle Ridge 12nm (Zen +) 8/16 105W AM4 400-Series DDR4-2933 Gen 3.0 2018 Ryzen 3000 Matisse 7nm (Zen 2) 16/32 105W AM4 500-Series DDR4-3200 Gen 4.0 2019 Ryzen 5000 Vermeer 7nm (Zen 3) 16/32 105W AM4 500-Series DDR4-3200 Gen 4.0 2020 Ryzen 5000 3D Warhol? 7nm (Zen 3D) 8/16 105W AM4 500-Series DDR4-3200 Gen 4.0 2022 Ryzen 7000 Raphael 5nm (Zen 4) 16/32? 105-170W AM5 600-Series DDR5-4800 Gen 5.0 2022 Ryzen 7000 3D Raphael 5nm (Zen 4) 16/32? 105-170W AM5 600-Series DDR5-4800 Gen 5.0 2023 Ryzen 8000 Granite Ridge 3nm (Zen 5)?

They wrongfully searched civilians and stole money from them, planted drugs and guns, and generally acted with brutal impunity, all with the protection of a badge. In 2017, all eight members of the GTTF were arrested on charges of federal racketeering and all were eventually sentenced to multiple years in prison. It remains a shocking scandal that not only laid bare the ruthless behaviour of officers hired to \"serve and protect\" the citizenry, but also the political failures that allow such behaviour to continue unfettered as well as the devastating judicial, legislative, and social effects their actions had on Baltimore at large.\n\nSimon and Pelecanos primarily follow GTTF ringleader Wayne Jenkins (Jon Bernthal), a formerly wide-eyed officer who slowly became inured to the casual corner-cutting and unlawful searches and arrests that fellow cops preached as conventional wisdom. His devolution into an aggressive thug serves as the series' backbone, but per their wont, Simon and Pelecanos branch out laterally across multiple different fields. They track Nicole Steele (Wunmi Mosaku), a Department of Justice lawyer in the Civil Rights Division examining the Baltimore Police Department in the aftermath of the death of Freddie Gray in police custody in 2015 and subsequent protests. There's also Sean Suiter (Jamie Hector), a homicide detective who was formerly in plain clothes units alongside the likes of Jenkins but now prefers systematic investigative work that involves community policing, as well as the multiple FBI agents and Narcotics Task Force investigators tracking the GTTF with surveillance and wiretaps.\n\nAn escalating problem\n\nWe Own This City sports an intriguing non-linear structure that initially seems haphazard but quickly reveals itself to be thematically compelling. Simon, Pelecanos, and the rest of the series' writers use meetings between the FBI and GTTF officers, who wish to cooperate with the investigation in exchange for more lenient sentencing, as the main avenue to tell the story of the unit's rise and fall.\n\nBut the series jumps back in time to multiple different periods, from the early 2000s, when Jenkins first comes onto the force, through to the mid 2010s when the FBI begins its investigation in earnest after the Narcotics Task Force accidentally recovers a tracking device used by GTTF officers in order to steal money from a local drug dealer.",

For most studios with tentpole fare, that’s 45 days, and for those titles with less commercial appeal or aimed at specialty audiences, it’s 17 days.\n\nWith a summer box office that’s loaded with such window-respecting movies as Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Top Gun: Maverick, Thor: Love & Thunder, Jurassic World: Dominion, Lightyear, Elvis, Nope, Bullet Train, and more, it’s pretty safe to say that most of the majors have gotten their jonesing for day-and-date out of their system. They’ve largely learned that collapsed windows siphon ticket sales, spur greater piracy and infuriates talent. Studio executives are re-awakening to the power of windows, and if there’s any indication to which way the wind is blowing, such architects of theatrical day-and-date, i.e. WarnerMedia Head Jason Kilar, have left the lot.\n\nZendaya and Tom Holland in ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ Sony\n\nAs Matthew Goode’s Robert Evans says in Paramount+ The Godfather series, The Offer, “You got brains, and you got balls” and that’s what it took for these studios, largely Sony, and yes, Universal, MGM/UAR, and others to bet on theatrical again as box office capitals LA and NYC reopened and return moviegoing to some semblance of normalcy.\n\nComscore Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian recently pondered about the success of Sony/Marvel’s Spider-Man: No Way Home, saying “Can you imagine if it had flopped?” If that pic’s box office of $804.3M domestic, and near $1.9 billion global didn’t happen, there would be a lack of faith among the motion picture studios about theatrical.\n\nFrom left: Sony’s Josh Greenstein, Marvel honcho Kevin Feige and Sony’s Sanford Panitch. AP\n\n“We realize that the old ways of doing business are the best means to making money,” confessed one major studio Boss to Deadline about remaining committed to theatrical; essentially admitting that the crazed pandemic, experimental ways of theatrical day-and-date didn’t optimize revenue. However, selling the same piece of content two-to-three times to the consumer; now that’s the way to make money.\n\nSo as we anticipate an endemic, it’s proper to tip our hat to Sony for having the longest theatrical window for a movie during the pandemic at 88 days with Spider-Man: No Way Home. Sony will fire up CinemaCon’s opening tonight with their presentation at Caesars Palace. They are the only studio without a sister streaming service. Because they’re focused on putting a box office value on their slate, that in turn swells the value of their pay-one TV deal with Netflix (for an exclusive 18 months) and pay 2 with Disney; both amounting to a reported $3 billion. The Disney deal covers Sony’s 2022-26 theatrical slate and will see them go to Disney-owned streaming services Disney+ and Hulu, as well as to Disney’s linear networks, including ABC, Disney Channels, Freeform, FX and National Geographic. The flow of Sony’s windows are largely 45 days of theatrical, followed by EST and DVD/Blu-Ray, and then entering a pay-one window on Netflix, and pay 2 on Disney.\n\nIn an industry that’s obsessed with gambling billions on streaming so that they can catch up with Netflix, that OTT service recently lost 200K subscribers. Sony is making money the old-fashioned way.\n\n“Our theatrical model is driving our success and that is our core business,” Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group President Josh Greenstein tells Deadline. “Our biggest movie ever had the longest window.” More power to the windows philosophy is the fact that Spider-Man: No Way Home scored an EST sales record after a long play in theaters. Industry finance sources estimate that Spider-Man: No Way Home netted well north of $610M in profit after all ancillaries.\n\nRiches lie for the Culver City lot in licensing their movies, rather than dump it exclusively on their own OTT service. WSJ called the studio “an arms dealer rather than a combatant in the streaming war.”\n\n‘Hotel Transylvania: Transformania’ Sony Pictures Animation\n\nNow, there are several exhibition and rival studio executives who’ve sniped that Sony has sent the most movies to streamers during the pandemic, i.e. Hotel Transylvania 4 to Amazon, Greyhound to Apple TV+, and more.\n\n“Streaming is additive to our business. It’s not our core business. We participate in the streaming economy strategically with certain films,” says Greenstein, “We’ve licensed some films to streamers during Covid, but our long-term big business model will always be driven by theatrical.”\n\nNote Sony doesn’t sell off their films to streamers, rather licenses them, keeping linear TV, home entertainment and all of China rights. What studio didn’t try to survive during the pandemic by jettisoning shelved content to streamers? Let him who is without sin cast the first stone. Sony licensed for financial survival whereas others did it to stunt their own streaming platforms.\n\nAdds Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group President Sanford Panitch about the studio’s diversity of product on the horizon, not just with Marvel films like Kraven the Hunter, but adult titles like Hello Sunshine’s Where the Crawdads Sing, “We’re betting on this concept of making product for everybody.”\n\nUNIVERSAL’S WINDOWING, DOWN TO A SCIENCE\n\nThey were the first to create an uproar before theaters completely shut down due to Covid with the day-and-date PVOD theatrical release of Dreamworks Animation’s Trolls World Tour, but Universal finally found its footing. Their movies opening to north of $50M would get a 31-day theatrical window, while those debuting under that threshold would get a 17-day window. This is immediately followed by a PVOD window, with the movie hitting sister streaming service Peacock at 45 days or 120 days after theatrical (and also the last four month’s of a movie’s 18-month pay-one window). Following the first Peacock window, there’s a split pay and TV network deals. In a multi-year deal in the ten-figure range, Prime Video nabbed the exclusive pay-one window (lasting months 5 through 14) for Universal’s live-action movies starting this year. Prime Video also got the rights to a package of UFEG’s library movies.\n\nMeanwhile, Universal’s animation titles will continue to stream on Netflix under a revamped multi-year deal, hammered out last summer. Uni’s animation movies will stream on Netflix during the middle 10-month portion of an 18-month pay-one partner window.\n\n‘The Northman’ Focus Features\n\nWhat does the new system mean? Does it mean that Universal box office bombs Dear Evan Hansen, Ambulance and The 355 will now profit given the shorter window? No, but under the new model, the concept is to earn the most revenue possible. Essentially, a movie hits its highest point of consumer awareness two weeks after it opens in theaters. That’s a prime time to capitalize on a home marketing campaign for anything that has fizzled. Get the movies into homes faster to maximize monies while it’s on top of the consumer’s mind. It’s why the $70M Viking epic The Northman wasn’t platformed: There was only so much money it could make box office wise out of the gate (a $12M opening); now it’s best to fast-track revenues. That’s the thinking at least behind Uni’s windows approach.\n\nEven before the box office bounced back, it was evident that each studio would have their own version of windowing to suit the diversity of their slate.\n\nMany Paramount Pictures theatrical releases will get 45 days of exclusivity in cinemas before they go to Paramount+ and transactional home entertainment prior to going to their pay-one window on Epix. Paramount+ will become the exclusive pay-one TV window starting in 2024 once the Epix deal expires. Paramount’s current pay-one window is 21 months.\n\nRobert Pattinson in ‘The Batman’ WB\n\nWarner Bros. announced it’s sending all of its movies to HBO Max 45 days after theatrical, which was the case with The Batman recently. The pic hit HBO linear on April 23, five days after debuting on HBO Max (April 18). The Matt Reeves directed movie is currently available to rent and and buy digitally. The Batman repped Warner’s first theatrical windowed title since practicing a theatrical-day-and-date HBO Max model that kicked off with December 2020’s Wonder Woman 1984. That pandemic model, which saw the studio’s titles on HBO Max for the first 30 days while they were in theaters (and exclusively theatrical in their second month before beginning a home ancillary downstream process) stifled grosses greatly (Dune and Godzilla vs. Kong were the only two movies to gross over $100M stateside last year). However, per the conglom’s executives, that plan drove subscribers to HBO Max. The change-up to a theatrical window with Batman has been lucrative with that DC title realizing $750M WW ($365M of that domestic) before it hit HBO Max on April 18. Despite the lackluster opening of Warner’s Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, the notion is that the J.K. Rowling movie will clear $100M before it arrives on HBO Max in late May.\n\nWhile Disney announced a 45-day exclusive theatrical window for a crop of movies back in September; their theatrical title continue on to Disney+ thereafter as part of a pay one TV window. Disney says they remain flexible to market conditions when it comes to distribution. Pixar’s Turning Red was originally set for theatrical release on March 11, but Disney made it go exclusively to Disney+ in an effort to spike subs. The movie scored the best global premiere on Disney+ ever; Samba TV measuring that 2.5M U.S. households watched the pic in its first weekend, that figure beating December 2020’s Soul (2.4M). Disney’s last Marvel movie, Eternals, debuted on Nov. 3, 2021 and hit Disney+ free to subs on Jan. 12 followed by a drop on DVD/Blu-Ray/4K UHD on Feb. 15. Meanwhile, Disney+/Hulu and HBO Max/HBO co-share the 20th Century Studios titles until the end of this year in a pay one deal.\n\nWith Netflix losing $54 billion in market capitalization in one day last week, and its balance sheets carrying $14.5 billion in long-term debt, Hollywood studios with their own streaming services should brace for a rude awakening. Some of these studios aren’t brands abroad like Disney and Netflix, so launching them overseas will indeed be a problem, and expensive. Can they do it? Or will they need to merge? With Disney spending $33 billion on streaming, linear and sports programming this year alone, how does that translate into revenue or profit per subscribers? Is all of this burning cash for the sake of algorithms? (Granted, Disney+ and Hulu do make quality series). In the end, it’s not about how many people are watching but quarterly subscriber churn. If Netflix faces its own recession, do all the streamers buckle? It sure looked that way last week as rival streamers Paramount Global, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery shares took a hit.\n\n‘Free Guy’ Disney\n\nAll of this should come as a lesson to the majors not to abandon their core theatrical business. People have been stuck at home for two years. If there was a made-for-streaming movie that was ever going to be popular and become a cultural phenomenon, it would have happened. Chew on this: Measure the wattage coming away from Free Guy and Red Notice. Which one are you more excited to see a sequel to? Free Guy‘s path though the windows system leaves a lasting impression after grossing $331M WW.\n\nThere’s something undeniable about the giant global marketing push of theatrical titles, and the experience of watching them in a theater together with a group of people; that makes them cultural events. The only way to really add value to IP is to make it have cultural impact. If the movie comes and goes like a million other things, it has no value.",

He was with his GF and baby girl in the store.\n\nRS suggests this video contradicts DaBaby's self-defense narrative, as he appears to be the aggressor in this situation -- at least based on what they posted. He charges at another man (not Craig) and the two get into a scuffle, with Craig monitoring on the outskirts.\n\nCraig appears to reach for and even brandish what was later determined to be a gun on his person -- but RS says his grieving family insists he never would've had to resort to grabbing it if not for DB's aggressive behavior setting this whole thing in motion.\n\nFrankly, it's unclear what exactly set all this off -- DB has claimed Craig and his pals were harassing and threatening him and his brood that night, which is why he went on the attack.\n\nWhile Rolling Stone appears to be questioning DaBaby's story of protecting himself, others have seen this video and agreed ... he had every right to pull his own gun and fire once Craig pulled his, especially since he wasn't the one directly involved in the fistfight.\n\n#DaBaby tried to knock out his artist #Wisdom backstage at a concert 👀🥊 What do y'all think happened? pic.twitter.com/gs66HVKtuN — No Jumper (@nojumper) April 23, 2022 @nojumper\n\nOf course, others say this video just proves DaBaby is a bad seed and apparently prone to violence ... something his own history since this incident seems to support, at least in some folks' eyes. As you know, he's been involved in countless physical altercations over the years.",

                "body": "Round 1 - Pick 1 Ikem Ekwonu OL NC State • Soph • 6'4\" / 310 lbs Projected Team Jacksonville PROSPECT RNK 10th POSITION RNK 4th Who knows what the Jaguars have planned here -- Trent Baalke last week said the team is eyeing four players -- but offensive tackle makes the most sense when it comes to keeping Trevor Lawrence upright.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 2 Aidan Hutchinson EDGE Michigan • Sr • 6'7\" / 260 lbs Projected Team Detroit PROSPECT RNK 1st POSITION RNK 1st Hutchinson starred at Michigan and now he moves a few miles down the road to join the Lions. He's the best player in this class and talk that he has already reached his ceiling is just that. He's 21 and he's only going to get better.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 3 Evan Neal OL Alabama • Jr • 6'7\" / 337 lbs Projected Team Houston PROSPECT RNK 2nd POSITION RNK 1st Edge rusher and cornerback are options here as well, but a team with so many holes should bolster the offensive line, especially if Davis Mills is the QB of the future (which appears to be the case).\n\nRound 1 - Pick 4 Kayvon Thibodeaux EDGE Oregon • Soph • 6'4\" / 254 lbs Projected Team N.Y. Jets PROSPECT RNK 6th POSITION RNK 2nd Thibodeaux has game-changing talents and, frankly, he's been all over the board in our mock drafts, mostly because teams have differing opinions on him. They're no denying he's just about unstoppable when he's locked in and the Jets desperately need to upgrade their pass rushers.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 5 Ahmad Gardner CB Cincinnati • Jr • 6'3\" / 190 lbs Projected Team N.Y. Giants PROSPECT RNK 3rd POSITION RNK 1st Gardner is our CB1, he had a fantastic 2021 season for the Bearcats, and he didn't allow a single touchdown during his career. We considered Charles Cross here too.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 6 Charles Cross OL Mississippi State • Soph • 6'5\" / 307 lbs Projected Team Carolina PROSPECT RNK 8th POSITION RNK 2nd Don't overthink it, Carolina. Fix the offensive line, worry about the QB position later, either next draft cycle or by working a trade for Baker Mayfield.\n\nFrom From Chicago Bears Round 1 - Pick 7 Travon Walker DL Georgia • Jr • 6'5\" / 272 lbs Projected Team N.Y. Giants PROSPECT RNK 13th POSITION RNK 1st First the Giants get the best cornerback in the class and two picks later they get Walker, who has been mentioned as the possible No. 1 overall pick. No offensive line help, but New York can address that in Round 2.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 8 Garrett Wilson WR Ohio State • Jr • 6'0\" / 183 lbs Projected Team Atlanta PROSPECT RNK 7th POSITION RNK 1st This team is bereft of offensive talent beyond Kyle Pitts and while QB is a need, you could argue that wide receiver is an even bigger one. And Garrett Wilson is special.\n\nFrom From Denver Broncos Round 1 - Pick 9 Derek Stingley Jr. CB LSU • Jr • 6'0\" / 195 lbs Projected Team Seattle PROSPECT RNK 5th POSITION RNK 2nd Again, QB would be an obvious choice here but Stingley feels like a Seahawks cornerback. He's coming off a fantastic pro day and Seattle has needs in the secondary.\n\nFrom From Seattle Seahawks Round 1 - Pick 10 Jameson Williams WR Alabama • Jr • 6'2\" / 179 lbs Projected Team N.Y. Jets PROSPECT RNK 11th POSITION RNK 2nd Williams would've been our WR1 had he not torn his ACL in January and while the Jets understand that he won't be ready to go to start the season, he would give Zach Wilson the type of big-play weapon he lacked as a rookie.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 11 Drake London WR USC • Jr • 6'4\" / 219 lbs Projected Team Washington PROSPECT RNK 12th POSITION RNK 3rd If Ron Rivera is intent on rolling with Carson Wentz -- and it appears that he is -- then the team might as well get him some weapons. At 6-foot-5, London was a high-point-catch machine before his '21 season ended prematurely with an ankle injury. He reminds us some of his former teammate at USC, Michael Pittman, and London has all the tools to be WR1.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 12 Trent McDuffie CB Washington • Soph • 5'11\" / 193 lbs Projected Team Minnesota PROSPECT RNK 22nd POSITION RNK 4th Two CBs are already off the board, but McDuffie is worthy of a top-12 selection. He was dominant on the outside at Washington but he can line up anywhere in the secondary, and having the opportunity to play alongside Patrick Peterson would be invaluable to his development.\n\nFrom From Cleveland Browns Round 1 - Pick 13 Kyle Hamilton S Notre Dame • Jr • 6'4\" / 220 lbs Projected Team Houston PROSPECT RNK 4th POSITION RNK 1st Fair or not, Hamilton's stock will be affected by his 40 times. That's great news for the Texans and Lovie Smith, who get one of the best defenders in this class at No. 13.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 14 Jermaine Johnson II EDGE Florida State • Sr • 6'5\" / 254 lbs Projected Team Baltimore PROSPECT RNK 19th POSITION RNK 3rd After transferring from Georgia, Johnson has a fantastic season at Florida State. And he told us at the combine that he felt like he had something to prove going from the SEC to the ACC. He did that and then some, then he dominated the Senior Bowl, and followed that up with an electric workout in Indy. The Ravens drafted Odafe Oweh a year ago and he'll get a running mate with Johnson here.\n\nFrom From Miami Dolphins Round 1 - Pick 15 Jordan Davis DL Georgia • Sr • 6'6\" / 341 lbs Projected Team Philadelphia PROSPECT RNK 17th POSITION RNK 2nd Davis dropped some weight, showed up at the combine and at 6-foot-6, 341 pounds, ran the 40 in 4.78 seconds, had a 32-inch vertical, and a broad jump of 10 feet, 3 inches -- and oh, by the way, he was a one-man wrecking crew in the SEC. It's easy to say Davis is a two-down player but his obvious strength and surprising speed make a legit three-down threat who just needs to refine his pass-rush arsenal beyond the bull rush. The biggest question is if he can keep his weight down, which directly correlates to his stamina, and his ability to stay on the field.\n\nFrom From Philadelphia Eagles Round 1 - Pick 16 Malik Willis QB Liberty • Jr • 6'1\" / 219 lbs Projected Team New Orleans PROSPECT RNK 23rd POSITION RNK 1st This almost certainly won't happen but this is where we'd target Willis, who has a ton of upside but is still extremely raw. It would also make the Saints' trade up a lot more palatable, taking a QB instead of, say, an offensive tackle here.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 17 Kenyon Green OL Texas A&M • Jr • 6'4\" / 323 lbs Projected Team L.A. Chargers PROSPECT RNK 27th POSITION RNK 6th Green can play outside or inside and at Texas A&M he lined up against some of the best defensive linemen and edge rushers in the country. The Chargers could go either tackle or guard here -- they have needs at both positions -- but with four tackles already off the board, Green makes sense here.\n\nFrom From New Orleans Saints Round 1 - Pick 18 Devin Lloyd LB Utah • Jr • 6'3\" / 237 lbs Projected Team Philadelphia PROSPECT RNK 20th POSITION RNK 2nd The Eagles signed Kyzir White to a one-year deal, but there are still needs at the linebacker position. Lloyd was impressive during the '21 season and nothing changed at the combine. He's the prototypical off-ball linebacker in today's NFL (pay no attention to his 4.7-something 40 times -- he plays immeasurably faster), and it's like he was built in a lab.\n\nFrom From Philadelphia Eagles Round 1 - Pick 19 Trevor Penning OL Northern Iowa • Jr • 6'7\" / 321 lbs Projected Team New Orleans PROSPECT RNK 35th POSITION RNK 8th Penning plays with an edge and the sole intent is to prove any remaining doubters wrong. He had a strong season and a dominant-at-times Senior Bowl week, and he could end up going in the top half of the first round when all is said and done. He'll fill a big need in New Orleans but the team still gets its QB with the scenario we lay out here.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 20 Tyler Linderbaum OL Iowa • Jr • 6'2\" / 296 lbs Projected Team Pittsburgh PROSPECT RNK 9th POSITION RNK 3rd The Steelers could go defensive line or wide receiver here but instead take a center, one of their weakest positions a season ago. Yes, the team signed Mason Cole in free agency but he's not guaranteed to win the job and Linderbaum brings some much-needed stability to the middle of the offensive line.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 21 Devonte Wyatt DL Georgia • Sr • 6'3\" / 307 lbs Projected Team New England PROSPECT RNK 28th POSITION RNK 4th Wyatt is another player who changed some minds with his Senior Bowl week and he continued to convince folks of his first-round talents by putting on a show at the combine. Incredibly quick off the snap and powerful once he gets going, he can be unstoppable when he's on his game.\n\nFrom From Las Vegas Raiders Round 1 - Pick 22 Treylon Burks WR Arkansas • Jr • 6'2\" / 225 lbs Projected Team Green Bay PROSPECT RNK 15th POSITION RNK 4th Burks is a contested and high-point catch machine. Don't be fooled by his 4.55 40 at the combine -- he regularly outran defensive backs to the end zone in the SEC and that won't change in the NFL. The scariest part of his game is that he's not even close to his ceiling yet, and what better way to get there than in Green Bay. He reminds us of some combination of Anquan Boldin, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Deebo Samuel.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 23 David Ojabo EDGE Michigan • Jr • 6'4\" / 250 lbs Projected Team Arizona PROSPECT RNK 44th POSITION RNK 6th Ojabo tore his Achilles at his pro day in March and that will undoubtedly affect his draft stock. But he is a terror off the edge and he's only been playing football for five years. He's a high-upside prospect who could see the field late in his rookie campaign.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 24 Zion Johnson OL Boston College • Sr • 6'3\" / 312 lbs Projected Team Dallas PROSPECT RNK 32nd POSITION RNK 7th Tyler Biadasz was good at times last season but there's certainly room for upgrading the interior OL. That brings us to Zion Johnson, who is another player who went to the Senior Bowl and proved he was worthy of first-round consideration. He played left tackle at Boston College and worked at guard and center in Mobile. He's a Day 1 starter at several positions.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 25 Daxton Hill S Michigan • Jr • 6'0\" / 191 lbs Projected Team Buffalo PROSPECT RNK 18th POSITION RNK 2nd This has been a popular pick for us over the months because of Hill's versatility. He's underrated nationally but watch him play and it becomes clear pretty quickly that he's in the running for one of the best defensive backs in this class. He's listed as a safety but he can line up anywhere.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 26 Bernhard Raimann OL Central Michigan • Jr • 6'6\" / 303 lbs Projected Team Tennessee PROSPECT RNK 21st POSITION RNK 5th Raimann has only been playing left tackle for two years but as a converted tight end, he has the athleticism to match up against the quickest pass rushers in the NFL. He's not yet a finished product but the tools are there to be a dominant offensive lineman in the NFL.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 27 Andrew Booth Jr. CB Clemson • Jr • 6'0\" / 194 lbs Projected Team Tampa Bay PROSPECT RNK 16th POSITION RNK 3rd Andrew Booth had a strong '21 season for Clemson and he's only going to get better with experience. Injuries could see him slip down draft boards but he's a first-round talent for us all day long.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 28 Nakobe Dean LB Georgia • Jr • 5'11\" / 229 lbs Projected Team Green Bay PROSPECT RNK 14th POSITION RNK 1st We don't get the concerns about Dean's size -- he's 5-foot-11, 229 pounds -- and we love everything about his game. He was the captain of that Georgia defense, is a playmaking machine in the middle of that unit, and oh by the way, he also had a 3.5 GPA in Mechanical Engineering.\n\nFrom From Miami Dolphins Round 1 - Pick 29 Chris Olave WR Ohio State • Sr • 6'0\" / 187 lbs Projected Team Kansas City PROSPECT RNK 29th POSITION RNK 5th Olave is probably the best route runner in this class but he alone won't be able to account for all of Tyreek Hill's offense. But he'll help, and more importantly, have a great chance to flourish with Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 30 Logan Hall DL Houston • Jr • 6'6\" / 282 lbs Projected Team Kansas City PROSPECT RNK 39th POSITION RNK 5th Last spring, some people were surprised Payton Turner made his way into Round 1. Don't be shocked if his Houston teammate, Logan Hall, follows a similar path. He was unblockable at times last season and at 6-foot-6, 275 pounds, he can line up just about anywhere.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 31 Kyler Gordon CB Washington • Soph • 6'0\" / 194 lbs Projected Team Cincinnati PROSPECT RNK 38th POSITION RNK 7th Trent McDuffie, who played with Gordon at Washington, described him as freakishly athletic, and that shows up consistently on tape. He can play inside or out, is physical at the catch point and is physical in run support too.",

However, multiple insiders, including The Athletic’s Lance Zierlein and NFL Media’s Peter Schrager, have projected Walker to the Jags at No. 1, noting general manager Trent Baalke’s fondness for players with elite physical traits.\n\nTravon Walker runs the 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine Getty Images\n\nTrent Baalke, GM of the Jacksonville Jaguars Getty Images\n\nWalker certainly fits into that category. At 6-foot-5 and 272 pounds, Walker ran a 4.51-second 40-yard dash and showed out in all of the other measurable drills at the combine.\n\nHowever, his production lags well behind the other edge rushers in the draft. He only had six sacks in 2021, the only season he spent as a full-time starter (he has appeared in 29 total games over three seasons). Hutchinson, meanwhile, had 14 sacks last season for the Wolverines.\n\nCheck out the best sports betting sites and apps\n\nIn Monday’s edition of the Football Morning in America column, Peter King wrote that he heard to “expect a surprise” out of Jacksonville – and speculated that it could mean Walker will be the pick. Vegas certainly appears to agree.",
