                "body": "CNN —\n\nThe US took new steps to ratchet up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday – announcing new economic sanctions to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine on the same day that US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other finance ministers walked out of a G20 summit in Washington in protest once Russia’s delegate began his remarks.\n\nThose moves were rich with symbolism about Western intentions to keep tightening the vise around Russia’s economy as the US and its allies try to isolate Putin on the world stage. But they looked feeble against the backdrop of Putin’s provocative test launch of Russia’s new intercontinental ballistic missile and the allies’ inability to save civilians as the latest evacuation attempts from Mariupol collapsed Wednesday.\n\nUS officials downplayed the importance of the missile test, noting they had been alerted of the launch window through international notification agreements, that they had tracked the missile’s path and believe it is not yet operational in Russia’s inventory. But after weeks of saber-rattling from Putin – including his February order putting nuclear forces on high alert – the Russian leader clearly hoped the move would unnerve the US and its allies as they weigh their next moves to help Ukraine.\n\nPutin’s threatening posture was evident in his statement after the test, when he argued that the weapon would “strengthen the combat potential of our armed forces, reliably ensure Russia’s security from external threats and provide food for thought for those who, in the heat of frenzied aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country.”\n\nSpeaking to CNN+’s Chris Wallace on Wednesday evening, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Russia’s test launch would not change the White House’s posture on aiding Ukraine and that the US would announce a new round of security assistance to Ukraine “in very short order.”\n\nBut the Russian leader’s latest chess move stood in marked contrast with the US decision in March to cancel a planned test of its Minute Man III intercontinental ballistic missile, which was described by Pentagon spokesman John Kirby at the time as an effort to avoid “any actions that could be misunderstood or misconstrued.”\n\n“I think the timing of this is very much about coercive threats to the West,” Jeffrey Edmonds, a former CIA military analyst and former director for Russia on the National Security Council, said of Russia’s missile test on CNN’s “Newsroom” Wednesday. “The more that he’s losing in Ukraine, the more we’re going to see this kind of escalated rhetoric.”\n\nThe inability of the US and its allies to sway Putin and halt the humanitarian disaster that continues to unfold in Mariupol was underscored by yet another failed attempt to evacuate scores of civilians, including women and children, who lined up in broad daylight in that embattled port city Wednesday hoping to board buses that would ferry them to safety.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a news conference with European Council President Charles Michel in Kyiv on Wednesday that about 120,000 people remain trapped In Mariupol and the “crimes that are happening there are far more scary and large-scale than in Borodianka,” a town where the bodies of many civilians were recently found after it was occupied by Russian forces.\n\nMariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko had urged residents to evacuate via three assembly points Wednesday – an operation that was supposed to begin in the early afternoon and proceed west from Mariupol toward the Russian-held city of Berdiansk and then onward through the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nUS Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland warned on CNN’s “New Day” that similar arrangements had “fallen apart a number of times before” because they hinged on the willingness of the Russians to allow that safe passage.\n\nUltimately, the humanitarian corridor “did not work as planned,” Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.\n\n“Due to the lack of control over their own military on the ground, the occupiers were unable to ensure a proper ceasefire,” she said, using a term to describe Russian military forces. “Also, due to the inherent disorganization and negligence, the occupiers were unable to provide timely transportation of people to the point where dozens of our buses and ambulances were waiting.”\n\nVereshchuk said they would try again Thursday. And two top Ukrainian officials – Parliamentary Majority Leader David Arakhamia and Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the President’s chief of staff – said they were standing by in the hopes of heading to Mariupol to negotiate the evacuation of both civilians and Ukrainian forces who have been holed up in the Azovstal steel plant in the city surrounded by Russian soldiers. Putin on Thursday scrapped plans to storm the steel plant, saying those who choose to surrender should be treated in accordance with international conventions, but ordered a blockade of the plant “so a fly cannot get through.”\n\nRetired US Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling on Wednesday described the standoff over humanitarian corridors out of Mariupol as an example of the Russians’ psychological operations – where they raise the hopes of the people who have been trapped in Mariupol and then dash them as part of Putin’s effort to “crush the will” of the Ukrainian people.\n\n“The long lines of people still in the cold out there after having hunkered down in basements is just another disappointment,” Hertling, a national security and military analyst for CNN, said on CNN’s “Newsroom.”\n\n“It’s an attempt by the Russian forces to continue to threaten and use tactics which harass the civilian population. Can NATO do anything about this? No. … NATO, the UN, other organizations have already asked for humanitarian corridors. There’s not much else you can do inside of a war zone when you can’t get forces in there to help people get out.”\n\nMore sanctions ahead of new military aid package\n\nAs the US prepares to announce a new military aid package for Ukraine in the face of intensifying fighting in the eastern Donbas region, Psaki framed the latest moves by the Treasury Department “as part of our stepped-up effort to crack down on those attempting to evade our unprecedented sanctions” during Wednesday’s news briefing.\n\nIn the new round of sanctions, the US targeted Transkapitalbank, which Psaki described as a “key commercial bank” that has offered services to other banks globally to help them evade international sanctions, as well as what US officials described as “a global network of more than 40 individuals and entities led by U.S.-designated Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev.” In its release, the Treasury Department said it was also going after companies in Russia’s virtual currency mining industry.\n\n“The United States is committed to ensuring that no asset, no matter how complex, becomes a mechanism for the Putin regime to offset the impact of sanctions,” the department said.\n\nYellen joined other Western officials in a planned walkout at the G20 summit during Russia’s presentation – a message to that country, Psaki said, that it cannot continue “business as usual” while carrying out its unprovoked assault on the people of Ukraine.\n\nThough President Joe Biden said last month that Russia should be expelled from the G20, removing it from the group would require the backing of all the members, which is considered unlikely.\n\nThe US is prepping another $800 million military assistance package for Ukraine, CNN previously reported, a week after the Biden administration announced a separate $800 million package.\n\nPsaki did not offer a clear answer when asked whether the US shares the sentiments of Michel, the president of the European Council, as he stood alongside Zelensky on Wednesday and said: “We are with you and will do everything which is possible to support you and to make sure that Ukraine will win the war.”\n\nShe said the US has been “pretty clear that we’re going to do everything possible to make sure President Putin and Russia recognize this is a strategic loss, that (Putin) is a pariah on the global stage.”\n\nWhen pressed on whether the concrete goal of the US in sending military aid to Ukraine is to produce a “battlefield defeat for Russia,” she stopped short of using that phrase.\n\n“We’re doing everything we can to equip the Ukrainian government, Ukrainian leaders, to effectively fight back in this military battle,” she said.",

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen Ukrainian forces repelled Russian troops aiming to capture the capital, Kyiv, they said they found some interesting baggage among the detritus of the Russian retreat – abandoned ammunition and armor, and inside the military vehicles, Russian parade uniforms. “They expected to get Kyiv in two days and then have a parade here,” said Oleksandr Hruzevych, the deputy chief of staff of Ukraine’s ground forces.\n\nFrida Ghitis\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin couldn’t get a parade in the Ukrainian capital, but a parade is coming soon to Moscow and, whatever happens on the battlefield, the Russian President is likely to declare victory during that event three weeks from now.\n\nMay 9 is when Russia marks one of its most important national holidays, Victory Day – the anniversary of Germany’s surrender at the end of World War II. The Kremlin has used that anniversary for more than 70 years to commemorate the successful heroism against the Nazis but, just as importantly, to proclaim to the Russian people and to the country’s friends and foes alike that Moscow’s leaders rule over a great and mighty power.\n\nVictory Day is all about military muscle, and when it comes in the middle of a war – even one that Russians are forbidden to call a “war” and one that state propaganda falsely claims is going perfectly according to plan – there’s almost no alternative but to use the occasion to boast of victory.\n\nUS intelligence assessments, Russian foreign policy analysts and common sense all indicate that Putin will use May 9 as a sort of self-imposed deadline in Ukraine. It’s not a deadline to win the war – that will likely not happen by then – but to pretend Russia has won something. Something major. Something important.\n\nThe campaign over the next three weeks will focus sharply on Ukraine’s east, the Donbas region by the Russian border, where there’s a larger concentration of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers, and where Russian-backed separatists have been waging war against the Ukrainian state for eight years.\n\nThat’s where Putin will seek a face-saving success, a concrete victory he can take to the Russian people to tell them he is still the larger-than-life leader whose “special military operation,” with all the hardship it is causing for Russians – let alone the calamity it is inflicting on Ukraine – has been worth the price tag. Unfortunately, his desperation for a win likely means that next three weeks are sure to bring even worse death and destruction to Ukraine.\n\nSo far, Putin’s war has produced almost exactly the opposite of what he wanted – strengthening Ukraine’s sense of nationhood, fortifying and unifying NATO and the West, tarnishing the image of Russia’s military forces and strategists, and on and on. And yet, Putin has been mostly successful at concealing those facts from the Russian people, shutting down independent media and prompting Russia’s genuine journalists to flee the country. That has left almost all Russians consuming only state-controlled media, which is little more than propaganda.\n\nBut even dictators need to worry about their domestic standing. If the Russian people view Putin’s Ukrainian adventure as the disaster it has been so far, his hold on power could weaken.\n\nEven under state-controlled information, some facts can eventually become impossible to conceal. Soldiers will return home to tell their stories to friends and relatives. Thousands will not return. And a small segment of the population may still get its news from abroad. Meanwhile, the Russian people, suffering in dire straits due to sanctions and the departure of many foreign companies from their country, may soon reach an economic breaking point. Either way, slowly the truth will seep in.\n\nThat’s why Putin urgently needs to show his campaign as triumphant.\n\nOn May 9, Putin almost certainly will stand in Red Square, on a stage built in front of the mausoleum where Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin’s embalmed body has lain on display for more than 90 years, and pretend all is well on his Western front. He will ceremonially review the troops – however many the military can spare from the massive deployment in Ukraine.\n\nWe will see if Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu makes an appearance. Until last year, he played a major role, his chest bedecked with medals, resplendent after bloody victories in Syria and Chechnya. These days, he leads a humiliated force and persistent rumors of his demise refuse to die.\n\nOn that day, Putin will likely announce something about Donbas. Perhaps he will declare it has been “liberated” from the “Nazis” whom he claims rule Ukraine (an absurdly false claim, given the Ukrainian President is Jewish himself). Maybe Russia will hold a phony referendum, as it did after it captured Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. If Russia releases a referendum showing most people in Donbas eager to join Russia, remember a recent independent survey does not support that claim.\n\nNot long after the 2021 Victory Day parade, Putin released an article arguing that Russians and Ukrainians are the same people. It was an ominous sign that Putin would try to erase Ukrainian identity, nationhood and its very borders soon after. Most people in Donbas, the one area of Ukraine where one would expect sympathy for Putin’s historical analysis, soundly reject that view. In an exclusive CNN poll, fewer than one in five agreed that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people.” Still, that is a key element or rationale for Putin’s war.\n\nAnother strategic victory for Putin could come if the port city of Mariupol falls, as Russian forces try to establish a land corridor between the territories they control in Donbas and Crimea. That would strengthen Moscow’s control over a large segment of Ukraine, amounting to much more than a symbolic victory. It would be a moral, strategic and economic blow to Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nTo secure any such victory by May 9, Putin will almost certainly unleash even more fury on eastern Ukraine. That will be met with uncompromising ferocity by Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN that Ukraine will not give up territory in the east to stop the war. If Donbas falls, he believes, Putin will target Kyiv again.\n\nTo resist the renewed onslaught, Ukraine needs even more help from the West. And Ukraine needs it fast. Putin’s desire to declare victory in three weeks will bring more suffering. But it has also put the Russian leader in potential peril. Whatever he announces on May 9 has to be credible. Otherwise, Putin knows he will become dangerously vulnerable.\n\nAfter all, the parade is happening in Moscow, not in Kyiv.",

                "body": "In 1996, the year that Vladimir Putin moved from St. Petersburg to Moscow to take a post inside Boris Yeltsin’s Kremlin, the government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta asked its readers a leading question: “Do you agree that we’ve had enough democracy, haven’t adapted to it, and now it’s time to tighten the screws?” The paper set up a hotline and offered the equivalent of two thousand dollars to any caller who could come up with a new “unifying national idea.” The exercise reflected an impoverished country demoralized and adrift.\n\nIllustration by João Fazenda\n\nAt around the same time, Yeltsin assembled a committee of scholars and politicians to formulate a new “national idea.” Perhaps the newspaper contest could feed the process. But the efforts went nowhere. Yeltsin had failed to build any momentum behind democratic ideals, and the political optimism of the period between 1989 and 1991 was, for most Russians, now a bitter memory. The Soviet-era social safety net had been shredded. People were tired of looking through shopwindows at glittering imports while a coterie of oligarchs were permitted to buy up the country’s most valuable state enterprises for kopecks on the ruble. Yeltsin won reëlection, defeating the Communist candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, but only by enlisting those oligarchs who, with self-preservation in mind, bankrolled him and helped cover up his exhaustion and his alcoholism. By the late nineties, democracy, demokratia, was referred to as dermokratia, shit-ocracy. Yeltsin’s support fell to the low single digits.\n\nThe same intellectuals who had dreamed of free speech, the rule of law, and a general movement toward liberal democracy now experienced acute feelings of failure. “There is no sense of what this new country, Russia, really is,” a prominent cultural historian, Andrei Zorin, said at the time, contrasting the atmosphere with the Enlightenment ferment that attended the birth of the United States and republican France. “These last four or five years in Russia have produced little besides pure hysteria.”\n\nPutin came to power, in 1999, advertised not as a man of ideology but as a figure of rude health and managerial competence. In truth, he was a man of the K.G.B., trained to view the West, particularly the U.S., as his enemy, and to see conspirators everywhere trying to weaken and humiliate Russia. He did not form any committees to devise a national idea; he set up no hotline. He established, over time, a personalist regime built around his patronage and absolute authority. And the national identity he has helped promulgate––illiberal, imperial, resentful of the West––has played an essential role in his brutal invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTo create the trappings of this Russian identity, Putin seized on existing strands of reactionary thought. While most observers paid closer attention to the intellectual and political turn to the West in the late nineteen-eighties and nineties, many Russian thinkers, publications, and institutions drew inspiration from far different sources. Newspapers such as Dyen (The Day) and Zavtra (Tomorrow) published screeds about the pernicious influence of American cultural and political power. Various academics celebrated the virtues of “the strong hand,” exemplified by such repressive tsars as Alexander III and Nicholas I and foreign autocrats such as Augusto Pinochet. A crackpot philosopher named Aleksandr Dugin published neo-fascist apocalyptic tomes about the eternal battle between the “sea power” of the West and the “land power” of Eurasia, and found an audience in Russian political, military, and intelligence circles.\n\nPutin, from his first years in office, was obsessed with the restoration of Russian might in the world and the positioning of the security services as the singular institution of domestic control. NATO’s expansion and the bombing of Belgrade, Iraq, and Libya propelled his suspicion of the West and his inward turn. He also recognized the importance of symbols and traditional institutions that could unify ordinary people and help define the particularities of a new Russian exceptionalism. He restored the old Soviet anthem with updated lyrics. He told interviewers and visitors that he was an Orthodox believer and did nothing to dispel rumors that he had taken on a dukhovnik, a spiritual guide, named Tikhon Shevkunov. Father Tikhon, who has appeared in films and runs the Web site Pravoslavie.ru., denied that he had notable influence over Putin (“I am no Cardinal Richelieu!”), but made it plain that he was a conservative nationalist who believed in the “special path” of Russia.\n\nIn 2004, when Ukraine was in the midst of its Orange Revolution, Putin not only called on his security services to combat Kyiv’s drift to the West; he turned up the volume on his conception of an imperial ideology. He began to speak approvingly of such conservative émigré thinkers as Nikolai Berdyaev and Ivan Ilyin, who believed in the exalted destiny of Russia and the artificiality of Ukraine. In case anyone missed the message, the Kremlin distributed the appropriate reading material to regional governors and bureaucrats.\n\nIn 2007, the year that Putin delivered a famous diatribe against the West, in Munich, he visited a writer and thinker who had once been considered the greatest enemy of the Soviet state: Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Like Putin, Solzhenitsyn believed that Russia and Ukraine were inextricably linked, and Putin tried to exploit Solzhenitsyn’s moral standing to underscore his own disdain for Ukrainian independence. What he conveniently ignored was Solzhenitsyn’s insistence, in 1991, that if Ukrainians chose to go their own way––as they did by a ninety-per-cent vote––he would “warmly congratulate” them. (“We will always be neighbors. Let’s be good neighbors.”)\n\nBy the time Putin returned to the Presidency, in 2012, his attention to distinctly conservative values had deepened. He cracked down on dissenters, vilifying them as “traitors,” an American-backed “fifth column.” He occupied Crimea and invaded eastern Ukraine. His vision of Moscow as a center of anti-liberal ideas and Eurasian power intensified. During the pandemic, he rarely met in person with his advisers, yet, according to the political analyst Mikhail Zygar, he spoke for days at his dacha with Yury Kovalchuk, a media baron and the largest shareholder in Rossiya Bank, who shares his messianic vision and sybaritic life style. In recent years, Putin has even succeeded in exporting his particular brand of illiberalism to, among others, the National Front, in France; the British National Party; the Jobbik movement, in Hungary; Golden Dawn, in Greece; and the right wing of the Republican Party. As Donald Trump’s ideologist, Steve Bannon, put it recently, “Ukraine’s not even a country.”\n\nThe devastation of Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities suggests that there is little mercy or modesty in Putin’s faith. Early in his reign, according to the journalist Catherine Belton, he went with his confidant, banker, and eventual antagonist Sergei Pugachev to an Orthodox service on Forgiveness Sunday, which is celebrated just before Lent. Pugachev, a believer, told Putin that he should prostrate himself before the priest, as an act of contrition. “Why should I?” Putin is said to have replied. “I am the President of the Russian Federation. Why should I ask for forgiveness?” ♦",

                "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is isolated — and getting more so. President Joe Biden calls him a war criminal. American intelligence says Putin’s own advisers are misleading him about the war, telling Putin what he wants to hear. So what’s going through this secretive, solitary dictator’s mind? We’ve found one man who thinks he knows the answer.\n\nJournalist and author Marvin Kalb has loved Russia for almost 70 years. In the early 1950s, he studied Russian history as a PhD candidate at Harvard. In 1960, he moved to Moscow as a reporter for CBS News. He’s interviewed many powerful Russians. But he’s never talked to Vladimir Putin. To get insight into Putin, Kalb says, it’s better to read about him than to interview him.\n\nFor an episode of Today, Explained, host Noel King talked with Kalb about how Putin has come to rely on a skewed version of history and an increasingly small circle of advisers — and what that means for the war in Ukraine. A partial transcript of their conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nMarvin Kalb\n\nI have found over the years that if you read intensely what a leader says or writes or thinks about himself, you’re going to get a pretty good idea of what he actually is. Sometimes in an interview, you get only what a major political figure wishes to convey. And he does that very well. Putin is an astoundingly good interview. And reporters who get interviews with him do very well because he can play to the personality. He knows how to deal with people. That’s terribly important to him.\n\nNoel King\n\nBased on your many years of reading and observing, and knowing that you have a keen sense into who people are, who is Vladimir Putin?\n\nMarvin Kalb\n\nVladimir Putin at the moment is a very lonely figure. He is finally a dictator. He used to be an authoritarian figure. He used to have the kind of power that a czar had. He is now an absolute dictator. And for him, that’s a bad thing.\n\nWhat it means is, on the one hand, he has absolute power to do whatever he wants in Russia. But the people around him are now terrified of him. And that means that they will tell him what they think he wants to hear. That is very bad for any leader of any country. Putin now is in desperate need of solid, 100 percent verified information, and he is not getting it. That is the belief of the US government, of Western nations, and I think, logically, given the history of dictatorship, that when you get to an absolute top point of power, you begin to lose it. And Putin now is in the process of losing the power that for most of his life, he sought to accumulate.\n\nHe is a former KGB official. One of the young men in the dying days of the Soviet Union who would try to live in the artificial world created by the KGB. He would imagine what the Western world was like. He would try very hard to understand it. He would pick up a language. The government gave him every opportunity to learn as much about the enemy as he could, and he did, and he thought he would be able to figure out how to manipulate the enemy so that he could destroy it. That was the whole point of the KGB operation. It was an intelligence unit, but it was also a unit that operated to achieve certain ends. And for the KGB, the end has always been the dissolution of the Western threat.\n\nNoel King\n\nWe know that US intelligence has tried to assess whether the pandemic changed Vladimir Putin’s mental state, whether isolation from the pandemic changed him. Was he a solitary person before the pandemic?\n\nMarvin Kalb\n\nEvery leader is, to some degree, a lonely figure, but Putin was not. Putin enjoyed being with people, but at the same time, he was always very suspicious of everybody. And so there was always a distance between him and anyone he was negotiating with. And certainly between him and a person he would regard as an enemy, and so, yes, distance existed. He was surrounded always by his own intelligence, his own ambition, his drive for power. And when he achieved that, he was very good at persuading the man above him, the president of Russia, [Boris] Yeltsin. In the 1990s, Yeltsin brought him down from St. Petersburg to Moscow and Yeltsin appointed Putin the head of the KGB, or the new version of it. And a couple of years later appointed him prime minister. And then when Yeltsin wanted to resign, he looked around and the only person he felt he could trust was Putin.\n\nSo Putin became his successor, and almost immediately established a new kind of governance in Russia. He had his KGB folks ready to roll into power not only in Moscow and St. Petersburg, but all over the country. It is a vast country. It extends over many time zones. It is difficult to run a country that large and Putin had his people in position to run it, he had control over the entire operation. He became the boss.\n\nNoel King\n\nAnd so who surrounds Putin now? Who are his advisers? Who are his friends?\n\nMarvin Kalb\n\nThe people who are around him now are the same people, more or less, who’ve been around him for the past 22 years. They are the people from the KGB. He allowed those people to take control over large economic assets in the country. Oil, gas, timber, invested in the hands of a very small group, and this small group proved to be effective enough for Putin to become the boss and run this very complex society.\n\nNoel King\n\nWhat does it tell you that Vladimir Putin has not made new friends over the last 22 years? That the same people who surrounded him when he was a KGB agent surround him as he is president of a world power?\n\nMarvin Kalb\n\nAnd that is an extremely important observation, because what we learn from it is that we are dealing with a man who had a certain vision of the world 20-30 years ago and retains it only in sharper form today.\n\nPlease remember, Putin is first and foremost a Russian nationalist. The question that comes into mind: is he an ultra-nationalist? By which, I mean, does he see everything from a Russian point of view? And the answer, unfortunately, is yes. And because he sees everything from a Russian point of view, he looks at a country, for example, like Belarus; at Ukraine; they are both Slavic. They are both Orthodox in religion and therefore in his mind, they are Russian. And it is not understandable to him at all that people who are authentically Russian, as he sees it, could ever be in rebellion against Moscow. In his mind, they have to be part of Moscow.\n\nSo we can look now at the war in Ukraine and say, “Isn’t it marvelous?” and indeed it is, that democracy appears to be holding on in Ukraine. For Putin, that is heresy. That is blasphemy. That is unacceptable. And so he will continue to fight to achieve the realization of what to him is perfectly normal.\n\nNoel King\n\nAt this point, it has become very clear, in both reporting from on the ground and in reporting from the US Pentagon, Vladimir Putin is not winning the war in Ukraine. It seems as though it’s too early to say he’s losing it. What does that do for his mental state, do you think?\n\nMarvin Kalb\n\nOh, I think it’s a shattering experience. That does not mean it totally undermines him. He’s a strong man and he’s very smart. He’s cunning, in fact. There’s a Russian word, хитрый, which means cunning, in a street corner sense. He understands power and he understands the utilization of power. He has very little patience for intelligence that comes to him saying, “We’re killing too many people.” Forget all of that. Where are we in terms of the end that I have articulated as our policy goal?\n\nIn fact, his policy goal, now, is never going to happen. He thought the war would be over within two or three days. We’re now into a second month and it may go on much longer than this. I hope not, but it’s possible. And in his mind, he is pursuing a legitimate historical goal. And can he lose? No. Can he persuade himself, ever, that he has lost? No. The only people who can persuade him will never persuade him, they will have to get rid of him in one way or another. And those are the people closest to him. They are the ones who know his mind, know his methods because they are the same people.\n\nAnd if they get rid of him, there may be somebody very much like him who would come into power, or if we are lucky … if we are lucky, we may get to see the other promise of Russia … of literature, of music, of history, of growth, of creativity — Russia and the Russian people, it’s a great society.\n\nAnd if there were another way of leaving the KGB mentality and reaching into the other Russia, we would all be so much better off led by the Russian people themselves. Is it possible? Yes. It’s there. It has to emerge from the soot and the gutter that it exists in today.\n\nListen to the full episode of Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, and Stitcher.",

                "body": "The city of Mariupol is now effectively in Russian hands. Although some Ukrainian troops continue to hold out at the Azovstal steelworks, the Russians have felt able to redeploy the forces used to assault the city. They leave behind an apocalyptic landscape that in many respects stands as a symbol of Russia’s strategic failure in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin set out to reanimate a Russian empire but has instead found himself master of a wasteland above ground and a mass grave beneath.\n\nThat Mariupol would be a target for the Russian military had been obvious since 2014, when Russian proxies initially seized the city and tried repeatedly to retake it after being driven out. A major industrial centre and port on the Sea of Azov, Mariupol would be economically vital to any annexed territory and in any case was on the main supply route from Rostov into southern Ukraine. The Russians assigned a significant force to take the city, though their composition shows that it was not Russia’s primary objective. The siege was prosecuted by troops from the 150th Rifle Division and 810th Naval Infantry Brigade reinforced with Chechen Rosgvardia and conscripted fighters from occupied Donetsk.\n\nThe Ukrainian military judged correctly that it would neither be Russia’s primary objective, nor easy to defend. Kyiv was the vital ground in the initial phase of the war, and with very limited stocks of anti-tank missiles and air defences the Ukrainian military prioritised these for the capital. Trying to hold Mariupol would have meant fighting for a corridor to resupply the city, fixing Ukrainian forces into a killing area within range of Russian artillery. Ukrainian troops in Mariupol were tasked with holding out for as long as possible so that Ukraine might live.\n\nSatellite imagery of fresh graves in Vynohradne, east of Mariupol. Photograph: Maxar Technologies Handout/EPA\n\nIn a war that has defied many expectations, the fighting in Mariupol conformed to conventional analysis. The Russian military surrounded the city on 2 March and proceeded to pin Ukrainian defenders into isolated pockets which could then be assaulted in turn. The Russians employed massive artillery fire to wear down the defenders, destroying most of the city in the process. In 1999 the Russians took six weeks to seize Grozny. Mariupol, with a slightly larger defence force, has been subjected to the same fate in seven. The Ukrainian general staff had feared it would fall sooner.\n\nThat Ukrainian forces held out for as long as they did testifies to the ferocity of the defence. Ukrainian troops in infantry fighting vehicles outmanoeuvred and defeated Russian tanks. Infiltration parties ambushed and destroyed Russian supply columns. Ukrainian helicopter pilots flew daring shuttles to drop off key supplies of food and ammunition. Supplies proved the critical bottleneck.\n\nThe Russians repeated their playbook from Syria. Strikes on hospitals and civilian shelters were used to terrorise the civilian population into evacuating. Driving the population from the city cleared the battlefield, allowing the Russians to concentrate against the defenders.\n\nSome Ukrainian troops are holding out at the Azovstal steelworks. Photograph: Mariupol City Council/Reuters\n\nThe will of the defenders to resist was also bolstered by their expectations of what Russian troops would do to them if they were taken prisoner. Mariupol’s defenders were made up of marines and members of the Azov battalion, a unit associated with a far-right political party and containing a significant proportion of neo-Nazis. Russian propaganda has used this unit to characterise the entirety of the Ukrainian military. Given that Russia declared the war to be a campaign of denazification, Azov members expected no quarter. With emerging reports of mass graves and atrocities, their fears appear justified.\n\nThe siege of Mariupol holds a number of military and political lessons. From the military perspective it underscores why the Ukrainians must prevent cities from being isolated. Once cut off from supply, the defence can only last so long. The siege also highlights why attacking Russia’s logistics is vital. The Russian military has enough artillery ammunition to keep up a continual bombardment equivalent to that unleashed on Mariupol for five years. The constraint on that firepower is Russia’s ability to move the ammunition to the guns.\n\nThe political lesson from Mariupol, however, is that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is an act of futility. Russia will have to level Ukraine’s cities if it wishes to occupy them. Underscoring the nonsense of Russia’s whole invasion is that among the troops sent to “denazify” Mariupol, many of Russia’s soldiers wore neo-Nazi insignia on their uniforms. As the Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno reportedly told fascist officers in 1936: “You will win, because you possess more than enough brute force, but you will not convince, because to convince means to persuade.” Mariupol tells us that any Russian victory in Ukraine will be hollow.\n\nDr Jack Watling is senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi)",

                "body": "In the early days of the war on Ukraine, tens of thousands of Russians protested an invasion launched in their name. This was encouraging. Americans could content themselves with the possibility that Russian citizens might take matters into their own hands, challenging and weakening their president, Vladimir Putin. In recent weeks, however, such protests have become rare. This is in no small part due to the criminalization of opposition; publicly contesting the Kremlin’s war propaganda carries prison terms of up to 15 years. But fear is only a piece of the story. Russians also appear to be rallying behind their president, raising the question of whether ordinary citizens are partly to blame for their regime—and perhaps even morally culpable.\n\nIf Putin’s regime and the Russian people are more intertwined than they initially appeared, a presumption of innocence becomes harder to sustain. According to the Levada Center, the closest thing to an independent pollster in Russia, Putin’s favorability ratings jumped from 69 percent in January to 83 percent in late March, a month into the so-called special military operation. Perhaps more ominously, Russians appear to be informing on one another in growing numbers, condemning friends, neighbors, and colleagues for insufficient support of the war effort. One hard-line member of Parliament noted that a “cleansing” was inevitable. In a speech, Putin himself colorfully praised his fellow Russians’ ability to “distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and simply spit them out like a fly that accidentally flew into their mouths.”\n\nCarl Miller: Who’s behind #IStandWithPutin?\n\nTo be sure, an 83 percent approval rating almost certainly overstates Putin’s support. Individuals may understandably hide their true preferences from pollsters, as a culture of paranoia spreads across the country. In tandem with reports of erstwhile Putin opponents embracing the war, however, we can fairly assume that a large number of Russians, and perhaps a clear majority, are indifferent to the atrocities committed in their name. What, if anything, should we make of this?\n\nDaniil Danchenko / NurPhoto / Getty\n\nOf course, the question of evil—and why ordinary people incline toward it—is an old one, destined to repeat itself with stubborn insistence. As my podcast co-host, Damir Marusic, an Atlantic Council senior fellow, recently wrote, “Putin is a wholly authentic Russian phenomenon, and the imperialist policy he’s pursuing in Ukraine is too.” This is right, but only up to a point. We simply don’t know what individual Russians would choose, want—or become—if they had been socialized in a free, open democracy, rather than a dictatorship where fear is the air one breathes. Like everyone else, they are products of their environment. Authoritarianism corrupts society. Because punishment and reward are made into arbitrary instruments of the state, citizens have little incentive to pool resources, cooperate, or trust others. Survival is paramount, and survival requires putting one’s own interests above everything else, including traditional morality. In such a context, as the historian Timothy Snyder puts it, “life is nasty, brutish, and short; the pleasure of life is that it can be made nastier, more brutish, and shorter for others.” This is the zero-sum mindset that transforms cruelty into virtue.\n\nIn short, authoritarianism twists the soul and distorts natural moral intuitions. In so doing, it renders its citizens—or, more precisely, its subjects—less morally culpable. To be fully morally culpable is to be free to choose between right and wrong. But that choice becomes much more difficult under conditions of dictatorship. Not everyone can be courageous and sacrifice life and livelihood to do the right thing.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine was very much Putin’s creation, his idiosyncratic bid to reimagine Russia. It is unlikely that something similar would have happened in his absence. While Russians have now hardened against their Ukrainian neighbors, early reactions to the war tended more toward surprise and even shock. Putin, after all, had repeatedly denied that he was planning to invade. This is why many of the Russian troops deployed to Ukraine did not seem to initially grasp that they were entering a war zone. If a referendum on an invasion of Ukraine had been held months ago, there is little reason to think that Russians would have been particularly enthusiastic. Putin’s war enjoys considerable popular support now, but that’s because it is too late to imagine an alternative. The war is a fait accompli. If Russians wish to continue living in their country and not get on the wrong side of things, acclimating themselves to this new reality is the best option, if not necessarily a moral or brave one.\n\nShadi Hamid: There are many things worse than American power\n\nRussians may be unique, just like all peoples are, but this does not mean that they are uniquely bad. Or, to put it differently, being good is hard if you live under an authoritarian regime. As the war rages on and anti-Russian sentiment grows, the temptation to see the Russian people as perpetrators rather than victims also grows. But to view them this way obscures something more fundamental: They too are victims, because they have been gradually stripped of their status as free moral agents. This is by design. Authoritarian leaders aim to implicate their own people in their crimes, which in turn allows them to both spread and dilute political responsibility. If responsibility is spread across the population, then so is guilt. To repudiate Putin would mean repudiating themselves.\n\nThis is yet another reminder of the elemental distinction between autocracies and democracies that President Joe Biden has highlighted in a series of speeches and other public statements. Americans have no trouble seeing Russia and China primarily as national-security threats and challengers to the United States, in part because they are. But there is a deeper divide—one that cuts to the very core of what it means to be a citizen and even a human being. Dictatorships elevate the nation and the leader as ultimate ends, while mere individuals have no inherent worth outside of their service to the state.\n\nDriven by an inherent logic of force and brutality, authoritarian regimes—particularly those with delusions of imperial grandeur—commit atrocities with indifference and even abandon. And they bring their populations along with them, willingly or unwillingly. This is what makes them doubly dangerous. It is also why the struggle ahead of the United States—and all democratic nations, whether they realize it or not—is likely to be a long one. As systems of government and ways of organizing society, democracies and dictatorships are irreconcilable. In a better world, coexistence might have been possible. But that is no longer the world we live in.",

                "body": "Russia has deployed the Wagner Group in military operations across at least half a dozen African nations.\n\nWhen abuses were reported in recent weeks in Mali – fake graves designed to discredit French forces; a massacre of some 300 people, mostly civilians – all evidence pointed to the shadowy mercenaries of Russia’s Wagner Group.\n\nEven before these feared professional soldiers joined the assault on Ukraine, Russia had deployed them to under-the-radar military operations across at least half a dozen African countries. Their aim: to further President Vladimir Putin’s global ambitions, and to undermine democracy.\n\nThe Wagner Group passes itself off as a private military contractor and the Kremlin denies any connection to it or even, sometimes, that it exists.\n\nBut Wagner’s commitment to Russian interests has become apparent in Ukraine, where its fighters, seen wearing the group’s chilling white skull emblem, are among the Russian forces currently attacking eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, Wagner has gained substantial footholds for Russia in the Central African Republic (CAR), Sudan and Mali. Wagner’s role in those countries goes way beyond the cover story of merely providing a security service, experts say.\n\n“They essentially run the Central African Republic” and are a growing force in Mali, General Stephen Townsend, the commander of US armed forces in Africa, told a Senate hearing last month.\n\nThe United States identifies Wagner’s financer as Yevgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch who is close to the Russian president and sometimes is called “Putin’s chef” for his flashy restaurants favoured by the Russian leader.\n\nHe was charged by the US government with trying to influence the 2016 US presidential election, and the Wagner Group is the subject of US and European Union sanctions.\n\n‘Hybrid war’\n\nRussia’s game plan for Africa, where it has applied its influence as far north as Libya and as far south as Mozambique, is straightforward in some ways, say analysts. It seeks alliances with governments shunned by the West or facing armed uprisings and internal challenges to their rule.\n\nThe African leaders get recognition from the Kremlin and military muscle from Wagner. They pay for it by giving Russia prime access to their oil, gas, gold, diamonds and valuable minerals.\n\nRussia also gains positions on a strategically important continent.\n\nBut there is another objective of Russia’s “hybrid war” in Africa, said Joseph Siegle, director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies.\n\nSiegle said Russia is also waging an ideological battle, using Wagner as a “coercive tool” to undermine Western ideas of democracy and turn countries towards Moscow. Putin wants to challenge the international democratic order “because Russia can’t compete very well in that order”, Siegle said.\n\n“If democracy is held up as the ultimate aspirational governance model, then that is constraining for Russia,” Siegle said.\n\nRather, Wagner promotes Russian interests with soldiers and guns, but also through propaganda and disinformation, as Prigozhin has done for Putin before.\n\nIn CAR, Wagner fighters ride around the capital Bangui in unmarked military vehicles and guard the country’s gold and diamond mines.\n\nThey have helped to hold off armed rebel groups and to keep President Faustin-Archange Touadera in power, but their reach goes much further.\n\nRussian national Valery Zakharov is Touadera’s national security adviser but also a “key figure” in Wagner’s command structure, according to EU documents accusing the mercenary group of serious human rights violations.\n\nUkraine war\n\nA statue erected last year in Bangui depicts Russian soldiers standing side by side to protect a woman and her children.\n\nRussia is cast as the country’s saviour and pro-Russia marches have been held in support of the war in Ukraine and to criticise former security partner France – though several protesters said they are paid.\n\n“A Central African adage says that when someone helps you, you have to reciprocate. This is why we have mobilised as one to support Russia,” said Didacien Kossimatchi, an official in Touadera’s political party. “Russia has absolved us of the unacceptable domination of the West.”\n\nKossimatchi said Russia was “acting in self-defence” in Ukraine.\n\nSuch support from African countries is a strategic success for Russia.\n\nWhen the United Nations voted on a resolution condemning the invasion of Ukraine, 17 of the 35 countries that abstained from the vote – nearly half – were African. Several other African nations did not register a vote.\n\n“Africa is fast becoming crucial to Putin’s efforts to dilute the influence of the United States and its international alliances,” said a report in March by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a non-profit set up by the former British prime minister.\n\nRussia’s strategy in Africa comes at a minimal cost economically and politically. Analysts estimate Wagner operates with only a few hundred to 2,000 mercenaries in a country.\n\nMany are ex-Russian military intelligence, Siegle said, but because it is a private force the Kremlin can deny responsibility for Wagner’s actions.\n\nThe real price is paid by ordinary people.\n\n‘More violence’\n\nThe people of CAR are not more secure, said Pauline Bax, Africa Program deputy director of the International Crisis Group think tank. “In fact, there’s more violence and intimidation,” she said.\n\nFrance, the US and human rights groups have accused Wagner mercenaries of extrajudicial killings of civilians in CAR. A UN panel of experts said private military groups and “particularly the Wagner Group” have violently harassed people and committed rape and sexual violence. They are just the latest accusations of serious abuses by the group.\n\nCAR in 2021 acknowledged serious human rights violations by Russians, which forced Russian ambassador Vladimir Titorenko to leave his post.\n\nThe Wagner Group has responded with a charm offensive – creating films designed to please the public, sponsoring beauty pageants and distributing educational materials that promote Russia’s involvement in Africa. Russian is now being taught in universities.\n\nRussia has taken its CAR blueprint to Mali and elsewhere in Africa. In Mali, there has been an “uprooting of democracy”, said Aanu Adeoye, an analyst on Russia-Africa affairs at the London-based Chatham House think tank.\n\nFollowing coups in 2020 and last year, France is withdrawing troops from its former colony that had been helping fight armed groups since 2013.\n\nWagner moved in, striking a security deal with Mali’s new military government, which then expelled the French ambassador and banned French TV stations. Tensions with the West have escalated.\n\nSo has the violence. Last month, Mali’s army and foreign soldiers who witnesses suspected were Russian killed an estimated 300 men in the rural town of Moura.\n\nSome of those killed were suspected fighters but most were civilians, Human Rights Watch said, calling it a “deliberate slaughter of people in custody”.\n\nThis week, when French forces handed over control of the Gossi military base, suspected Wagner agents hurriedly buried several bodies nearby and a Russian social media campaign blamed France for the graves. The French military, however, had used aerial surveillance after their withdrawal to show the creation of the sandy graves.\n\nBoth atrocities bear the hallmarks of Wagner mercenaries and Russia’s foreign policy brand under Putin, say several analysts.\n\n“They have no concerns about minor things like democracy and human rights,” said Chatham House’s Adeoye.",

                "body": "History is teetering on an edge. No one knows which way it will go. Maybe the Russian empire, the last and most terrible of the European empires, will fall. Or maybe it will absorb the hit and survive as it has survived and expanded since the 17th century. You’d be a fool to bet against it. The graveyards of Eurasia are full of those who did.\n\nAnd yet the breathtaking heroism of the Ukrainian resistance and the insane self-delusion of the Putinist regime are allowing Russia’s opponents from Syria to Central Asia, and from Georgia to Moldova, to ask that most revolutionary of questions: “What if?”\n\nWhat if the empire falls? What if structures that have endured and enslaved for centuries can be blown apart like the creaking trucks in a Russian munitions convoy?\n\nTalking to the men and women engaged in what is – if only the global left could see it – the great anticolonial struggle of our times, you hear them moving through the stages of revolutionary commitment. From peaceful protest to jail sentences to the realisation that civil disobedience will never be enough.\n\nNon-violent tactics work only against regimes that are not so oppressive that they cannot be persuaded to change\n\nLives are transformed as the stakes are raised. The story of Timur Mitskievich echoes the anticolonial protests of the 20th century. In 2020, he was a teenager in Minsk when the Belarusian dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, rigged the presidential election as he had crushed every challenge to his rule since he came to power in 1994. Supporters of the opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya took to the streets in the largest popular demonstrations in Belarus’s history.\n\nThe paradox of civil disobedience is that non-violent tactics work only against regimes that, however oppressive the protesters think them, are not so oppressive they cannot be persuaded to change. For all their crimes and prejudices, the British imperial authorities in India in the 1940s and the US government of the 1960s had to listen to Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Lukashenko did not listen to his opponents. He terrorised them. He didn’t have to worry about bad publicity when he controlled the media. Nor need he concern himself with the reaction of the “international community” after Vladimir Putin said he would maintain the dictator in power if he gave up what little remained of Belarusian independence. His country became a Russian colony again, which it had been almost continuously since the Russian empire seized control in 1795.\n\nThe 17-year old Mitskievich joined the protests. The police beat him so badly doctors put him into a medically induced coma. While he was out, his mother died, leaving nine orphaned children.\n\nPeaceful disobedience works only against regimes with a capacity for feeling shame and the Belarusian and Russian regimes have no shame.\n\nBelarus, like Ukraine before 2014, is a country parochial westerners barely thought about. If its name registers today, it is as Russia’s base for its failed assault on Kyiv. In the glib 1990s, liberal democracy’s triumph was assumed to be so inevitable we called Belarus “Europe’s last dictatorship”. Look at its weirdness, we said. It still clung on to Soviet-style rule, an error that history would surely correct as the ideals of free markets and free societies marched on.\n\nThe Ukrainian war has made clear how Russian nationalists view Slavs with the impertinence to reject them\n\nInstead of being an anachronism, Belarus was a model for the future. While it became a Russian client state, Russia became a supersize Belarus, as Putin removed the limited freedoms he had allowed Russian citizens in the 2000s and aped Lukashenko’s dictatorship.\n\nTo Belarus’s exiled opposition, Ukraine’s war is their war and a Ukrainian victory would open up the prospect of radical change across territories Russia intimidates and controls. The Ukrainian war has made clear, if clarity were needed, how Russian nationalists view eastern Slavs with the impertinence to reject them. Russian official media explained that Ukrainians (and by extension) Belarusians were really Russians. If they rejected Russian identity and said they had their own cultures and histories that existed before the Russian empire, they proved only that they were “Nazis”. No form of human life could be lower. The Russian state had a duty to kill them or send them to labour camps; to take their children from them and crush their country and their culture.\n\nWhen I spoke last week to Tsikhanouskaya’s senior adviser Franak Viačorka, in exile in Poland, he said revolution was the only viable option now. He spoke the language of an officer in an underground war rather than a politician trying to negotiate a settlement. The Lukashenko regime was the “collaborationist state”. The activists who sabotaged Belarusian railway lines, to stop Russian troops and armour reaching Ukraine, were “resistance cells”.\n\nEven in Soviet times Moscow “recognised the existence of Belarus and Ukrainian nations”, Viačorka said. Putin was bringing a “new form of fascism” that denied their very being. The Belarusian opposition was fighting it with covert action. It was attempting to drive the army away from its subservience to Lukashenko and Putin. In Belarus, as in so many other countries, hope depended on a Ukrainian victory offering the “chance to get out of Russian sphere of influence”.\n\nWell, we’ve learned better than to be optimists in the years since the fin de siècle’s silly season. We expect brute power to prevail now. The Russian armed forces are undoubtedly corrupt and inept. But you can see the empire winning, as it has always won, by throwing recruits into battle without a thought for their lives and terrorising civilians. For its part, western intelligence is not predicting a swift Ukrainian victory but a hard, grinding war whose outcome is uncertain.\n\nFor all that, there is in the air, if not optimism, then a plausible question. What if the partial collapse of the Russian empire in the 1990s is followed by decisive defeat in the 2020s? What if the whole rotten structure falls?\n\nThe doctors released Mitskievich from hospital. He is now fighting in Ukraine in the Belarusian version of the International Brigades of the Spanish civil war. He is one of thousands of Belarusians who volunteered to join the Kastuś Kalinoŭski Battalion, named after the leader of an uprising against the Russian empire in 1863. The battalion has seen action in the battles around Irpin. One day, its members will return to Belarus with highly portable military skills. They will have questions of their own.",

Some social media users are sharing a years-old claim that Putin built key Russian institutions.\n\n\"Vladimir Putin. He ended the Rothschild's (sic) control over Russia by nationalizing the Russian centralized bank,\" reads text in a Facebook post shared over four years ago. \"He banned (genetically modified organisms) and created a currency to compete against the dollar.\"\n\nThe post has generated more than 39,000 shares since it was published March 14, 2018, and it has recently regained traction on Facebook. Similar posts have racked up hundreds of interactions on Facebook.\n\nBut the claim is off the mark, as independent fact-checking organizations have reported.\n\nFollow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks\n\nThe Russian bank was nationalized long before Putin's first term in office, the Rothschilds were never in control of Russia and Putin did not create a currency. But he did ban GMOs in the country.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the social media users who shared the claim for comment.\n\nCentral bank created in 1800s\n\nRussia's first central bank – the main public credit institution in the country – was created a century before Putin was inaugurated as president in March 2000.\n\nFormer Russian Emperor Alexander II established the institution, originally called the \"State Bank,\" in 1860 for the purpose of \"short-term commercial lending,\" according to its official website.\n\nFact check: False claim that Putin rescued 35,000 imprisoned Ukrainian children\n\nThe move was also an attempt to reorganize the Russian National Commercial Bank. The bank was created in 1818 to \"improve the country's credit institutions\" but did not have the \"status of central bank,\" according to the Boris Yeltsin Presidential Library.\n\nUSA TODAY found no evidence the origins of the bank had anything to do with the Rothschilds, a wealthy Jewish banking family that has frequently been the subject of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.\n\nThroughout the 1900s, the State Bank served many roles, including \"covering military expenditures\" during World War I and initiating foreign exchange, according to its website. It was renamed the \"Bank of Russia\" in 1992 after the Soviet Union disbanded.\n\nRothschilds never controlled Russia\n\nUSA TODAY found no evidence the Rothschild family ever controlled Russia.\n\nNone of the family members' names appear on a list of Russian leaders dating back to 1267. Their names also don't appear on a list of senior government officials who served in 2018, the year the Facebook post first circulated.\n\nBut Rothschild & Co., the family's financial advising company, does have an office in Moscow, according to an archived version of the company's website. It has been there for close to a decade.\n\nFact check: No evidence Putin banned Rothschild family from Russia\n\nUSA TODAY previously debunked a claim that Putin banned the Rothschild family from entering Russia.\n\nRussian government banned GMOs under Putin\n\nFormer Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich first announced the Russian government's plan to ban GMOs at an international biotechnology conference in 2015, according to Reuters.\n\nThat plan came to fruition in 2016, when the State Duma passed a bill June 24 that established \"a ban on the cultivation and breeding\" of GMO plants and animals in Russia, except in cases of \"examinations and research work.\"\n\nThe bill also required \"importers of GMO products\" to fill out a mandatory public registration, according to TASS, a Russian state-owned news agency. The upper house of the Russian parliament approved the bill June 29, 2016, and Putin signed it into law July 4.\n\nRuble goes back centuries\n\nThere is no evidence Putin created a new form of currency in Russia, as the post claims.\n\nThe origins of the ruble, Russia's official currency, \"can be traced back to the 13th century,\" according to Britannica. In 1704, Russian Czar Peter I initiated the \"first regular minting of the ruble in silver,\" the encyclopedia says.\n\nFact check: Putin's claims justifying war in Ukraine are baseless, experts say\n\nPutin first announced a plan to create a form of digital currency known as the crypto-ruble in 2017, according to Investing.com. The Financial Times reported in 2018 that Putin had \"commissioned work\" on the development of the crypto-ruble as Moscow sought to circumvent Western sanctions at the time.\n\nBut USA TODAY found no reports that the digital currency was in use by 2018, when the post was published.\n\nOur rating: Partly false\n\nBased on our research, we rate PARTLY FALSE the claim that Putin nationalized Russia's bank to end the Rothschilds' control, banned GMOs and created a currency to compete with the dollar. Putin did sign a law banning GMOs, but the rest of the post's claims are wrong.\n\nRussia's central bank was established in 1860, more than a century before Putin started his first presidential term. The Rothschild family never controlled Russia. And Putin did not create a new form of currency.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Guterres will then travel to Kyiv on Thursday, where he will meet Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.\n\nIn both visits, Guterres aims to discuss “steps that can be taken right now” to stop the fighting and help people get to safety, UN Spokeswoman Eri Kaneko said at a briefing in New York.\n\n“He hopes to talk about what can be done to bring peace to Ukraine urgently,” she said.\n\nGuterres has called the Russian invasion “the saddest moment” in his five years in the UN’s top job. His appeal earlier this week for a four-day “humanitarian pause” ahead of Orthodox Easter fell on deaf ears.\n\nGuterres had asked to meet the leaders of both nations in separate letters handed to their countries’ permanent missions to the United Nations in an attempt by the UN to regain the diplomatic initiative.\n\nThe UN Security Council has been hamstrung over the war because Russia is one of the five permanent members with a veto. In March, 141 countries in an emergency session of the General Assembly backed a resolution condemning the war and calling on Russia to “immediately, completely and unconditionally” withdraw its forces from Ukraine.\n\nThe now-planned trip “is a visible symbol of what the United Nations is supposed to be standing for, which is peace and security,” former UN Political Affairs Chief Jeffrey Feltman told the Associated Press news agency.\n\n“I don’t think any of us should have exaggerated expectations about what the secretary-general will be able to accomplish, but he has significant moral power,” added Feltman, now a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC. “It’s important that the secretary-general have these conversations.”\n\nThe organisation’s top humanitarian official visited both capitals earlier this month to explore the possibility of a ceasefire, and concern is mounting over the fate of civilians in Mariupol.\n\nThe strategically-important port city is surrounded by the Russian army and Ukrainian soldiers and civilians are holed up in a vast steel plant on the coast. In its latest assessment, the Institute for the Study of War said the Russian strategy appeared to be “to starve out” the remaining soldiers and civilians.\n\nUkraine, meanwhile, has said it is hopeful that humanitarian corridors could be opened on Saturday to allow civilians to leave.\n\nGuterres has had little contact with Zelenskyy since the war began, speaking with him just once by telephone on March 26.\n\nPutin has not taken Guterres’s phone calls or had any contact with him since the UN chief said the invasion violated the UN charter.",

Some of the cards, the suspect allegedly told an undercover agent, were sold to people headed to the Tokyo Summer Olympic Games last August, including three Olympians.\n\nWhile the suspects were allegedly linked to schemes valued at $149 million, officials said the actual loss to the government totaled about $20 million.\n\nIt's Amy and Chelsey with today's top stories out of Washington.\n\nPutin has declared victory in Mariupol. But there's 'no evidence' the fighting is over.\n\nAfter reducing Ukraine’s eastern port city of Mariupol to rubble, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday called the military campaign there a success, something he desperately needs as the war grinds into its third month.\n\nIt's anything but.\n\nRussia stopped short of routing hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the strategic city’s giant steel plant. Both Ukraine and President Joe Biden have rejected Putin’s claim of victory.\n\nWhat is clear is that Mariupol’s residents have endured some of the worst atrocities committed by the Russians even as Russia has lost an estimated quarter of its combat forces in Ukraine – troops, aircraft, tanks ships and other equipment – since the war began Feb. 24.\n\nThough Putin was forced to retreat from his goal of taking Kyiv, he’s pushing for territorial gains in eastern Ukraine. Military victories could give him the stronger hand he needs to wrest concessions in a peace negotiation, or at least allow him to save face at home.\n\nBiden announces new aid package: Biden committed $800 million in additional military aid to Ukraine on Thursday and rolled out a process to welcome Ukrainian refugees displaced by the war, beginning next week.\n\nThe latest infusion of security assistance, which matches the amount committed last week, includes 72 howitzers, 72 trucks to tow them, 121 Phoenix Ghost drones, other heavy artillery and 144,000 rounds of ammunition. Biden said the aid will \"further augment Ukraine's ability\" to fight Russian attacks in the eastern Donbas region.\n\n“We're in a critical window now of time, where they're going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,” Biden said.\n\nWant this news roundup in your inbox every night?

CDC believes this is a lawful order, well within CDC’s legal authority to protect public health.\"\n\nThe decision has prompted the Justice Department to immediately file a notice of appeal in line with its promise Tuesday to appeal the judge’s ruling based on the CDC’s decision.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle said this week that the CDC failed to justify the order and didn't follow proper rulemaking procedures. In response, the CDC said Monday it would no longer enforce its mask requirement on mass transportation systems, though masks were still recommended in indoor public settings.\n\nBut White House press secretary Jen Psaki said an appeal is needed not just to preserve the 15-day extension of the mandate but to preserve \"CDC authority over the long-term\" in case the pandemic worsens again. \"Because as we've noted from here, we expect there to be ups and downs of the pandemic.

                "body": "The Biden administration deserves credit for laying the groundwork for multilateral sanctions, which are the only kind that have the hope of success. The greatest effects seen so far from the sanctions have been by unplugging Russia, if only partially, from the international financial system through moves like freezing billions of dollars in assets overseas and taking some Russian banks off SWIFT, the global messaging system for financial transactions. These far-reaching punishments, unthinkable even a few months ago, displayed a new sense of cooperation among the United States and the other Group of 7 countries.\n\nEven Mr. Putin acknowledged that they have “achieved certain results.” But focusing on helping Ukraine financially and with military equipment might prove more productive than thinking up new sanctions on Russia. The Biden administration appears to recognize this, at least in part, with its latest $800 million in military aid and $500 million in emergency funding announced on Thursday.\n\nSanctions alone — at least any sanctions that European countries would be willing to now consider — will not bring Russia to its knees any time soon. As long as Europeans still depend on Russian oil and gas, Russia will be able to depend on significant income from that relationship. The spat over whether gas deliveries will be paid in rubles, as Russia has demanded, only highlights the bind that European countries find themselves in.\n\nThe oligarchs who are losing their yachts and the people who are tightening their belts have little sway over the Kremlin. In Russia, with average citizens, Mr. Putin has grist for a loud “I told you so” about the West’s purported longing to bring down Russia.\n\nWill the sanctions imposed by the Group of 7 nations truly isolate Russia? No. A number of countries, including Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and, most significantly, China, remain on friendly terms with Russia. The fact that this list also includes archrivals Pakistan and India, as well as Iran and Israel, illustrates Mr. Putin’s influence as an arms dealer and a power broker in South Asia and the Middle East.\n\nThe United States could tighten the economic screws on Russia by imposing secondary sanctions. U.S. officials already appear to be threatening as much in meetings and calls with officials in India and China. Secondary sanctions are a powerful tool to compel other countries to get in line with American policy. But the potential benefits need to be weighed against the risks and costs. The extraterritorial application of American laws can also incite deep resentment, even from European allies at times. Secondary sanctions should be used sparingly, and only after consultation with partners.\n\nSanctions can have other unintended consequences as well. They can actually end up strengthening a dictator’s grip on power by tightening state control over the economy. Private businesses can have a hard time weathering the storm of sanctions, but authoritarian regimes and their state-owned enterprises often find ways to circumvent them. Sanctions also provide dictators with a credible external enemy to blame for the misery of their people. Instead of pushing people to rise up against their rulers, sanctions often inspire a rally-around-the-flag effect. After Western sanctions were placed on Russia in 2014, in the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea, 71 percent of Russians saw them as an attempt to “weaken and humiliate Russia,” according to an independent poll.",

Andersson’s recent comments represent a significant shift in her view on the value of NATO membership. Early last month , she said that Sweden joining the alliance would “further destabilize this area of Europe and increase tensions.”\n\nAndersson’s change in opinion is indicative of evolving views among the citizens of both countries in reaction to the steady stream of horrifying news out of Ukraine. In a recent poll, 68% of Finns said they support joining NATO , up from just 24% last year. For the first time ever, a majority of Swedes said they also favor joining, according to a poll released this week.\n\nAlthough both nations have deep cultural and economic ties with Europe, Finland and Sweden have historically declined to pursue NATO membership — even as more than a dozen countries in eastern Europe have joined the alliance since the fall of the Soviet Union. Sweden’s resistance is rooted in its policy of neutrality, which dates back to the early 1800s. After fighting off a Soviet invasion during World War II, Finland established a formally neutral position, largely to avoid provoking further aggression.\n\nFormed in the aftermath of World War II, NATO is a military alliance built on the principle of collective defense — meaning that all NATO countries agree to come to the defense of any individual member that comes under attack. Russia considers NATO to be a direct threat, and Russian President Vladimir Putin said the possibility that Ukraine might join motivated his decision to launch the Russian invasion. Russia’s Foreign Ministry has warned of “serious military and political consequences” if Sweden and Finland join the alliance.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy there’s debate\n\nSupporters say there are clear benefits to adding Sweden and Finland to NATO. They argue that the invasion serves as a startling reminder of how dangerous it can be for countries on Russia’s borders. If they were NATO members, the two Nordic countries would have the force of some of the world’s most powerful militaries — including the U.S. — as a bulwark against any Russian incursion.\n\nSome defense analysts believe NATO and its members have plenty to gain by bringing in Sweden and Finland. Though both nations are relatively small, experts say their militaries are still formidable. The two countries would also provide a valuable strategic foothold along Russia’s northwest flank, particularly along Finland’s 830-mile border with Russia. Others say expanding NATO would be yet another nonmilitary means of punishing Putin for his assault on Ukraine.\n\nBut skeptics worry about potential retaliation from Putin, particularly at a time when he’s vulnerable and liable to lash out. Some also argue that increasing NATO’s foothold along Russia’s border would create opportunities for conflict that could spiral into another world war.\n\nThere are also those who believe that NATO shouldn't exist at all. Some on the right believe that the alliance allows smaller nations to neglect their own defense capabilities, knowing that major powers will come to their rescue. Observers on the far left, on the other hand, say that anything that promotes military force over nonviolent forms of collaboration is ultimately harmful to the world.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nThere are two major steps that need to be taken before Sweden and Finland could become part of NATO. First, their Parliaments would have to formally vote to join. Then, the legislatures of each of the 30 current NATO countries would have to approve their membership — a process that has taken about a year in the recent past.\n\nPerspectives\n\nSupporters\n\nThe war in Ukraine has made it obvious why Sweden and Finland should join\n\n“Who can blame the Finns and the Swedes for wanting to jump right in? … After seeing what's happening to Ukraine, they don’t want to be the next Ukraine. And it’s clear that Putin does not want to challenge any of the NATO countries directly.” — Kevin Baron, Defense One executive editor, to MSNBC\n\nRussia probably isn’t willing to go to war to keep Sweden and Finland out of NATO\n\n“Putin views Finland and Sweden differently than Ukraine because of their different histories. Ukraine is seen as part of an imagined ‘Russian world’ by Putin. Sweden and Finland are, therefore, less comparable to Ukraine, beyond their proximity to Russia.” — Thomas O Falk, Al Jazeera\n\nAdding new NATO members is a sound, nonmilitary way to punish Russia\n\n“It would be a dramatic reversal of fortunes and would demonstrate the agility of the liberal democratic countries in applying the diplomatic element of power, well below the threshold of war, that gray-zone space in which Russia — and, for that matter, China — has been so nimble in the recent past.” — Michael Miklaucic, The Hill\n\nBoth countries would bring plenty of benefits to the NATO alliance\n\n“Finland and Sweden wouldn’t be alliance freeloaders. Their strategic location in the Baltic Sea could be critical in a wider conflict with Russia. Finland already punches above its weight militarily, and wealthy Sweden can afford its announced defense-spending increases. A secure Europe better capable of defending itself serves American interests.” — Editorial, Wall Street Journal\n\nUkraine is a reminder of our responsibility to protect each other\n\n“Ukraine is a game-changer in European security. The real threat to fellow member-states leaves us all with no option but to look again at how we see our responsibilities to one another.” — Editorial, Irish Times\n\nNATO membership would have saved Ukraine\n\n“If only NATO was more popular amongst Ukrainians and properly marketed as a security guarantee against Russia, Ukraine could have been saved from eight or more years of violence and suffering. The lesson to be learned is that NATO did not enlarge far or fast enough.” — Daniel Ramallo, National Interest\n\nSkeptics\n\nRussia might attack to keep Sweden and Finland out\n\n“Would Russia seriously consider an attack on Finland or Sweden? While it may seem unlikely, the West should not underestimate the possibility that Mr. Putin, feeling isolated, backed into a corner, and under a time constraint, may make an otherwise rash decision.” — Sascha Glaeser, Washington Times\n\nA greater NATO presence on Russia’s border increases the odds of catastrophic conflict\n\n“Finland—if it allows NATO bases, troops, and weaponry within its borders—could permanently heighten the hair-trigger environment that now exists between the Kremlin and Washington.” — Michael Hirsh, Foreign Policy\n\nNATO’s expansion after the Cold War inspired Putin’s invasion of Ukraine\n\n“If there had been no decision to move NATO eastward to include Ukraine, Crimea and the Donbass would be part of Ukraine today, and there would be no war in Ukraine.” — John Mearsheimer, political scientist, to New Yorker\n\nNATO makes the world less safe\n\n“To the degree that this rudderless security pact has made war easier, more salable, and more attractive for Western leaders than diplomacy, the alliance has been a liability to peace and stability.” — Chase Madar, The Nation\n\nGreater militarism will never create a path to peace\n\n“Europe goes ahead and arms itself to the teeth to protect itself. … So therefore, [Russia says] we have to arm ourselves to the teeth to defend ourselves from the onslaught of this extraordinarily powerful force against NATO. I mean, if anybody’s observing this from outer space, they’d be cracking up in laughter.” — Noam Chomsky, linguist and political commentator, to Intercept\n\nThe U.S. shouldn’t sign up to protect even more weak countries\n\n“We have to understand that nothing is done in a vacuum, and for Finland and Sweden to be added to NATO adds a burden to the entire alliance. … And it adds yet another level of potential risk for the United States.” — Daniel Davis, foreign policy expert, to The Hill\n\nIs there a topic you’d like to see covered in “The 360”?

He said a military solution “means that we decide to escalate the conflict,” which would therefore start “a new world war.”\n\nMacron said that France had sent a lot of military equipment to Ukraine, adding: “If we had not done so, Kyiv would probably have already fallen.” He said Paris and Berlin had decided not to interfere directly in the war and instead send military equipment to Kyiv.\n\nThe remarks came as pressure is mounting on France and Germany to supply heavy weapons to Ukraine. European countries on the front lines such as Poland and Estonia have been calling on Berlin especially to send tanks to Kyiv.\n\nMacron said that if he wins on Sunday, he would “not rule out at all” talking again with the Russian president, though he would first speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Stopping dialogue with Putin, Macron explained, would mean leaving the negotiations to other powers, such as “the Turkish president [Recep Tayyip Erdoğan], the Chinese president [Xi Jinping] or others.”\n\nIf that happens, “ it will be the non-Europeans who will build peace in Europe … So, even if it is very hard, even if it is sometimes ineffective, you have to insist,” he said in an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\nOn Sunday, voters in France will decide who will be their president for the next five years, with Macron ahead in the polls. Both candidates will hold their final election rallies on Friday before campaigning stops at midnight.\n\nGiorgio Leali contributed reporting.",

                "body": "In a rematch of the 2017 election, France will decide tomorrow between the erstwhile centrist disrupter Emmanuel Macron and the far-right fixture Marine Le Pen. Although this contest once seemed inevitable, the emergence last fall of the wild-card extreme-right media personage Éric Zemmour—whose campaign outflanked Le Pen’s and threatened to cannibalize it—meant that Le Pen had to struggle just to remain this cycle’s challenger. Even more surprising, in the first round of voting, on April 10, she only squeaked past the extreme-left curmudgeon Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whose formidable showing polls had repeatedly failed to anticipate.\n\nWhatever happens tomorrow, then, the story of this election cycle is the appeal of the extremes against Macron, who just a few years ago burst onto the political scene as an Obama-like golden boy. That’s worrying for Macron, of course, and dangerous for the health of transatlantic liberalism more broadly.\n\n“If you put together the far left and right, two-thirds of French voters support an anti-liberal, pro-Putin candidate,” the author and journalist Marc Weitzmann told me. “Given what’s at stake today in Europe, if Macron loses, Putin wins.” This is a dark turn of events indeed, at the very moment France finds itself the de facto head of the European Union and Europe finds itself, post-Brexit and freshly devoid of the steady German leadership for so long embodied by Angela Merkel, confronting on its own soil a Russian menace.\n\nBack in March, Macron’s reassuring statesmanship in the face of the Ukrainian crisis seemed to have secured his reelection. Apparently too busy to campaign and loath to debate while doggedly keeping the lines of communication open with Moscow (and posing for Zelensky-esque photo ops in jeans and hoodies), he quietly put out a letter declaring his candidacy a mere 24 hours before the deadline. His opponents, meanwhile, scrambled to distance themselves from unseemly affiliations with and praise for Vladimir Putin. In the run-up to the 2017 presidential election, Le Pen had flown to Moscow to meet with Putin; three years before that, her party borrowed 9 million euros from a Russian bank. Mélenchon—like Le Pen, a bitter critic of NATO—has controversially advocated “non-alignment” on the global stage. His rivals on the left were quick to accuse him of “indulgence” toward Putin’s regime and even “complicity” in his crimes.\n\nYet Le Pen’s numbers held as she shrewdly turned her focus to pocketbook issues. She avoided Paris and toured the downwardly mobile rural and postindustrial segments of France, including Macron’s own hometown of Amiens, where her National Rally party has flipped large numbers of voters in former leftwing strongholds to the xenophobic right.\n\nMélenchon, for his part, condemned the Russian invasion, and continued to reap the benefits of his post-2018 shift in rhetoric about mass migration. During the European crise migratoire of 2015 and 2016, he had argued, echoing Le Pen, in favor of protecting French workers against “social dumping.” But by 2019 he was accusing Donald Trump of racism for thwarting migrants’ ambition to survive. Expected to receive about 15 percent of the vote in the first round at a time when the political center of the country has lurched to the right, he ended up with 22 percent, less than half a million ballots out of second place. He also captured the Muslim vote.\n\nThat success can be explained, in part and in hindsight, by Mélenchon’s oratorical skill and a lack of commitment to the polarizing secularism known as laicité, as well as a willingness to loosen a traditionally class-based discourse on the left in favor of one more accommodating to the current dictates of identity. Now whichever way his following breaks—including staying home or casting blank “protest” ballots—will have an enormous impact on the political future of France.\n\nGoing into the election, both Le Pen and Macron are courting—or aspiring to offend the least—Mélenchon’s unpredictable base. That left-wing voters would even consider supporting Le Pen (whether directly or through abstention) is a damning indictment, of both the president’s five-year strategy of reactively meeting Le Pen on her own discursive turf and the commitment of large swaths of French society to basic liberal norms.\n\nIn chaos, however, there is opportunity. “Mélenchon does not intend to stop at third place,” Le Monde reported on April 19 after the candidate directly appealed to voters to elect him prime minister in the legislative elections to be held this June. “If this cohabitation does not suit the president, he can leave. I will not leave,” Mélenchon warned. He even indicated that he would be open to being Le Pen’s prime minister—a stunning acknowledgment from the ostensible left.\n\nAlthough, unlike Zemmour, he has not directly encouraged his supporters to vote for Le Pen, his party pointedly released an unofficial poll on its website claiming that more than 60 percent of the people supporting Mélenchon will stay home. A Le Pen victory would mean that Macron’s political future is closed and the fate of his party, La République En Marche!, which destroyed the traditional center-left and center-right parties in 2017, will be insecure. In such a scenario, Mélenchon would be the only viable alternative to the governing regime.\n\nWednesday’s grueling, at times stupefying, nearly three-hour debate seems unlikely to have altered the basic electoral math. Macron, whose body language betrayed exasperation at even having to entertain Le Pen (Jacques Chirac famously refused to debate her father, Jean-Marie, in 2002), focused on revitalizing French industry and strengthening the European Union in the face of grave threats. Le Pen again cast herself as a populist “obliged to be the spokesperson of the people,” intent on liberating Muslim women from the veil and solving a cost-of-living crisis in the provinces. “My main takeaway from the Mélenchon group is that they hate Macron way more than they hate Le Pen,” Mathieu Lefèvre of More in Common, a think tank studying polarization in Europe and America, told me about the interviews he conducted ahead of the vote. “I worry that the result of the debate and Mélenchon’s calls to ‘elect me prime minister’ will lead to low turnout among his crowd.”\n\nAnd so Macron, whom the latest polls now grant a more comfortable 10-point lead, is left as the unloved, even despised, yet ultimately indispensable bulwark in the contemporary French—and therefore wider European—landscape against a reckless insularity among both extremes. Older voters seem to grasp this intuitively. “Mr. Macron has baby-boomers to thank for his success,” the Economist noted while observing that without voters over 60, the president wouldn’t have even qualified for the second round. “The extreme left doesn’t seem so threatening to those who do not remember the cold war.”\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine was supposed to be a wake-up call—a reminder not only of Le Pen’s prior embrace of Putin, but of the larger reality that elections have consequences, nationalist demagoguery is nothing to toy with, and those deprived of liberal democracy are willing to die trying to access it. The irony—and, depending on tomorrow’s outcome, the tragedy, perhaps—is that while so many French voters have been blinded by personal animus and numbed by domestic haggling, the most potentially destructive stakes of this election remain global in scope.",

                "body": "Placeholder while article actions load\n\nIn the days before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Donald Trump and some of his top allies decided that it was a good time to build up Vladimir Putin. Trump called Putin’s actions “genius” and “savvy.” Former secretary of state Mike Pompeo agreed that Putin was “very shrewd” and “talented,” saying he had “enormous respect” for him.\n\nThe defense offered was that they were speaking pragmatically — merely acknowledging Putin’s formidability. It’s important to understand what your foes are capable of. (Trump, of course, conspicuously and repeatedly declined entreaties to offer moral judgments of Putin.)\n\nEven that explanation, though, has suffered significantly as the war has unfolded over the past month and a half. Americans increasingly agree that Putin is a nefarious figure, on par with some of the most reviled foreign leaders of recent decades. Increasingly, they also think that he is not especially savvy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn early March, U.S. News and YouGov released a poll asking people about Trump’s comments — but without attributing them to Trump. Just 15 percent agreed with Trump’s estimation that Putin’s stated justification for the war was “genius.”\n\nBut people were more willing to entertain the idea that Putin was indeed pretty savvy. More than a quarter of people said calling Putin “very savvy” matched their opinion at least “somewhat closely,” and that number shot up to 49 percent among 2020 Trump voters. Another YouGov poll at the time showed that 50 percent of Trump supporters called Putin a “strong leader” and 41 percent called him “strategic.”\n\nNow, not so much.\n\nA new YouGov poll conducted for the Economist also asked people about a range of descriptors for Putin, ranging from “savvy” and “genius” to “evil.” Just 15 percent overall agreed Putin was “savvy,” 7 percent called him “rational” and 25 percent called him “strategic.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe poll asked about some characteristics in both surveys. The number saying Putin was a “strong leader” dropped from 31 percent to 23 percent, “paranoid” went from 30 percent to 41 percent and “out of control” went from 50 percent to 57 percent.\n\nThe shifts were even bigger among Trump supporters. While 50 percent called Putin a “strong leader” in late February, that number is down to 36 percent. Views of Putin as paranoid and out of control both increased by double digits. Those calling Putin himself a “genius” — slightly different from Trump calling Putin’s strategy genius — has dropped slightly, from 12 percent to 7 percent. Those calling him “strategic” declined from 41 percent to 32 percent.\n\nEven in late February, though, the writing was on the wall: Polls showed that Americans weren’t particularly interested in such a supposedly nuanced view of Russia and Putin. People of all political persuasions quickly rejected the idea — on offer from the likes of Tucker Carlson and a few prominent Republicans — that the war in Ukraine does not really concern us. Negative views of Russia returned to Cold War levels. While 39 percent of Republicans had a favorable opinion of Putin after it was revealed that he had tried to help elect Trump in late 2016, that number dropped to 14 percent (and now to 10 percent in the most recent survey). Soon, Putin became so reviled that people viewed him about as negatively as Kim Jong Un, Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro at their most notorious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the weeks since, Russia has struggled to defeat an inferior — or at least, less-resourced — Ukrainian military, apparently abandoning efforts to take the capital, Kyiv. Late Wednesday, the Ukrainians claimed that they had successfully attacked Russia’s top warship in the Black Sea, the Moskva. While the facts remain unclear, a crippling missile strike would be a remarkable practical and symbolic victory, especially since it was reportedly the ship that the Ukrainians defied on Snake Island.\n\nSome have wagered that Kyiv was never really the objective, and that Russia’s true aim was eastern Ukraine. “What if Putin didn’t miscalculate?” asked a recent column from conservative New York Times columnist Bret Stephens. There’s certainly a valid debate about both Putin’s strategy and the possibility that Russia’s invasion could still accomplish significant objectives.\n\nBut for now, the myth of Putin has been punctured — even among many conservatives and Trump supporters.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

                "body": "Placeholder while article actions load\n\nMore than six weeks into his war against Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin is feeling the sting of failure. Thousands of Russian battlefield deaths. Three front-line retreats by the Russian military. Millions of Ukrainians who will never forgive Moscow. More isolation than ever — and perilously few goals achieved.\n\nPutin is now regrouping to focus his military campaign on Ukraine’s east in what is widely seen as “Plan B,” after his forces failed to topple Ukraine’s government or wrest control of its biggest cities. All the while, questions are mounting about how a Russian leader steeped in security policy and known for railing against the folly of regime-change wars could have sleepwalked into a such a strategic morass.\n\nAt issue is a broader quandary that will occupy historians for years: How could Russia — a country with such deep familial, cultural and historic ties to its western neighbor — get Ukraine so wrong?\n\nOfficials in the United States and Europe are piecing together the answer to that question. What emerges, those officials say, is a picture of a hubristic and isolated leader, beset by biases and skewed information, pressing forward with a calamitous decision without consulting his full cohort of advisers. Putin rushed headlong into Ukraine, confident in his ability to secure a quick victory and weather any blowback within the authoritarian system he erected at home, they said. Underpinning his assumptions: misconceptions about Ukraine fundamentally rooted in Moscow’s colonial past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Historically, there just hasn’t been expertise on Ukraine in Russia at all,” said Alina Polyakova, president and CEO of the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis. “When you don’t believe a country’s a real country and a people’s a real people, why would you invest any expertise in a thing you don’t think exists?”\n\nInvestigators exhumed 21 of at least 67 bodies suspected to be lying in a mass grave in Bucha, Ukraine, April 8. (Video: Joyce Koh/The Washington Post)\n\nA former spy’s fingerprints\n\nIn the run-up to the war, some leaders in Europe and Ukraine discounted the possibility that Putin would invade, because they didn’t see sufficient Russian forces amassed along the border for Moscow to succeed with a multi-front offensive and subsequent occupation.\n\nWhat they didn’t realize was that Moscow was nurturing deeply flawed assumptions, particularly about the fortitude of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the willingness of Ukrainians to resist, and was indeed planning a large-scale invasion — just an ill-conceived one. The operation, analysts said, bore the fingerprints of Putin himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s clear this was a military operation designed by spooks, not generals,” said Mark Galeotti, an honorary professor at University College London and senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. “It makes no sense in purely military terms.”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Bucha, Ukraine, on April 4 after becoming aware of the atrocities carried out by Russian troops. (Video: Reuters)\n\nAccording to U.S. and European officials, Putin had been keeping the plans very closely held, with top military commanders and trusted advisers unaware that Russia was going to mount an offensive.\n\nThe Russian leader notoriously doesn’t use a smartphone and rarely accesses the Internet. He spent years snuffing out Russian independent news and erecting an authoritarian system of government devoid of constructive feedback or dissent. By early this year, according to U.S. and European officials, he was operating in an echo chamber, surrounded by advisers who, according to Galeotti, “had learned you do not bring bad news to the czar’s table.” Putin’s isolation, the officials said, had been compounded by the coronavirus and his limited contact with others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s demonstrably obvious now that there was a combination of people not telling him what he needed to hear and him not listening when they did tell him stuff that he didn’t want to hear,” said James Cleverly, Britain’s minister of state for Europe and North America.\n\nPutin has long viewed independent Ukraine as a quirk of the Soviet empire’s collapse that needed to be handled personally. According to Russian journalist Mikhail Zygar’s book “All the Kremlin’s Men,” Putin for years controlled policy toward Ukraine himself because he didn’t trust anyone else.\n\n“We need to deal with Ukraine or we’ll lose it,” Putin would say at meetings dating back to the early 2000s, according to Zygar, who labeled Putin’s coterie of close advisers the “Collective Putin,” because they tend to tailor their activities to anticipate his desires.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutin’s confidence in his personal expertise on Ukraine came through in a lengthy treatise he published last summer. The article portrayed Ukrainians as a people who are naturally the same as Russians but have been taken hostage by Western governments bent on radicalizing them against Moscow.\n\n“That leads to this belief by Putin and others that if you can just decapitate the Zelensky government, knock out the political leadership, then there will be an outpouring of pro-Russian sentiment by the rest of Ukrainian society,” said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.\n\nRussia got Ukraine wrong “because this was totally a Putin-directed operation,” said a U.S. official who specializes in Russia and like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.\n\nPutin, the official said, “is as convinced as anyone can be of his truths.”\n\n‘An enormous amount of arrogance’\n\nThe assumption of a quick Ukrainian government collapse undergirded the invasion, according to Ukrainian, U.S. and European officials. In the early days of the war, Russian state news already began promoting the notion that Zelensky had fled, even as he posted videos from Kyiv.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky has vowed to remain in Ukraine as Russia continues its advance. The president's past life as an actor may have prepared him for this moment. (Video: Allie Caren/The Washington Post, Photo: Brian Monroe/The Washington Post)\n\nPutin had witnessed a rapid collapse of the Ukrainian government when former president Viktor Yanukovych decamped to Russia in 2014. According to Zygar, Putin shouted at Yanukovych not to leave Kyiv and described him as a “cowardly piece of s---” when he fled the capital in response to a pro-Western uprising. Those events may have led Putin to imagine a similar scenario with Zelensky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutin’s misconception about Ukrainian weakness was paired with a swaggering view of Russian power. He famously boasted to a top European official in late 2014 that he could easily seize Kyiv “in two weeks” if he desired — a misconception he appeared to continue believing until he attempted to do so.\n\n“He has an unwavering belief in his ability to control events,” a senior NATO intelligence official said.\n\nPerhaps no moment underscored the level of misconception more than the attempt by elite Russian paratroopers at the outset of the invasion to land at the Hostomel cargo airport northwest of Kyiv — apparently with the intention of sweeping breezily into the Ukrainian capital.\n\n“Just looking at how this played out, it feels there was an enormous amount of arrogance,” a European official said. “You look at the insertion of the airborne forces at Hostomel airport, which was clearly designed to do a decapitation [mission] in Kyiv — and they got smashed.”\n\nAlexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, said the Russian leadership doesn’t see Ukraine, a place once controlled by Moscow, as deserving of rigorous study.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There was this false sense of familiarity,” Gabuev said. “That’s what Russia completely misunderstood.”\n\nOnce the assumptions proved false, Russia’s military proved unable to regroup, saddled by fuel, ammunition, transport, food and other logistics problems, as well as demoralized soldiers who hadn’t been told they were about to fight a war.\n\n“If the initial plan is bad and none of the other preparation is there, there’s no durability,” Rand Corp. senior defense analyst Scott Boston said.\n\nRussia relies primarily on its foreign intelligence service, the SVR, to collect information about countries such as the United States and China, but when it comes to countries in the “near abroad” including Ukraine, Moscow enlists the FSB, primarily a domestic intelligence service.\n\nAndrei Soldatov, a Russian journalist who specializes in Russian intelligence, said the FSB regularly failed to understand the popular and grass-roots movements fundamental to Ukraine’s political culture.\n\nUkrainian military forces performed controlled detonations of mines in the eastern city of Kharkiv on April 11. (Video: Julie Yoon/The Washington Post)\n\nU.S. and European officials said Russia’s poor performance in the initial stages of the war has led to a bad blood between the Russian military and intelligence establishments and a serious search for scapegoats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat exactly Russian intelligence was reporting to Putin regarding Ukraine before the war is unclear, but multiple U.S. and European officials said Putin’s immediate advisers had shown an unwillingness to give the Russian president information that challenged his assumptions. Individuals lower down in Russia’s security establishment thought the invasion was ill-conceived but their concerns didn’t reach the top, the officials said.\n\nIn U.S. and European intelligence circles, the FSB’s reputation stands in contrast to the ruthless, cunning reputation of its predecessor, the KGB. Several current and former officials described the Russian security service as rife with corruption, beset by bureaucratic bloat and ultimately out of touch.\n\nA Ukrainian intelligence official said the FSB had spent millions recruiting a network of pro-Russian collaborators who ultimately told Putin and his top advisers, among them the current FSB director, what they wanted to hear: The central government in Kyiv wouldn’t hold and resistance would collapse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe official singled out pro-Russian politician Viktor Medvedchuk, who made Putin the godfather of his daughter, as a significant source of misleading information. Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian politician who has long promoted Russian interests, was charged with treason last year. Ukrainian authorities initially said he escaped house arrest shortly after the invasion, but Zelensky posted a photo of him captured and in fatigues on Tuesday, crediting Ukrainian intelligence with apprehending him.\n\nEuropean officials said the Kremlin was also getting information from out-of-touch former elites associated with Yanukovych, who, like Medvedchuk, stood to gain from a Russian power grab. In the weeks before the invasion, the British government warned that Russian intelligence was plotting with Yanukovych’s former prime minister, chief of staff and deputy prime minister.\n\nRegardless of the information stream, Putin believes himself to be the biggest expert on Ukraine, Soldatov said, noting the tendency of Russian officials to assume they understand Ukraine.\n\n“This level of chauvinism — you can see it everywhere,” Soldatov said. “It’s a direct legacy of this unfortunate imperial past.”\n\nDan Lamothe contributed to this report.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

This will provide a land corridor to the Crimea, as well as influence the vital objects of the Ukrainian economy,” he said.\n\n“Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are also facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population,” the Russian commander added, referencing the separatist region of Moldova that already has a large Russian military presence.\n\nWill Russia Invade Moldova’s Transnistria Region?\n\nRussia has had a large military presence in the Transnistria region since 1992 when Russian forces became involved in the Transnistria War. Would Russia dare press all the way to Moldova next?\n\nAt the end of the war, which saw the Soviet 14th Guards Army assist Transnistrian separatist forces fighting against Moldovan troops, Russia established a permanent military presence in the region.\n\nTransnistria also declared independence from Moldova in 1990, and while no member of the United Nations recognizes the sovereignty of the region, it’s not unlike Russian President Vladimir Putin to ignore international agreements or consensus.\n\nWhat’s more, Transnistria is not a member of NATO, and Moldova – as the poorest country in Europe – is unlikely to be capable of initiating a substantial military defense against invading Russian forces.\n\nA Russian invasion of the territory, therefore, may simply attract international condemnation but little in the way of military pushback – unless Moldova requests military support or supplies from NATO countries, and allies comply.\n\nAt present, Russia controls much of Ukraine’s eastern and southeastern territories, and controls Ukraine’s eastern coastline on the Black Sea. Russian troops have since struggled to expand their control westwards. Minnekaev’s comments seem to suggest that Russian troops will next refocus their energies not just on the east, but on pushing westwards from Crimea, further into Ukrainian territory and all the way to Moldova.\n\nJack Buckby is a British author, counter-extremism researcher, and journalist based in New York.

                "body": "This weekend, millions of Russians and Ukrainians will mark Orthodox Easter with painted eggs and special holiday cakes blessed by local priests. These traditional Easter celebrations are among the few things the neighboring lands still have in common as the war launched by Vladimir Putin two months ago grinds on.\n\nReligion has long been at the heart of the troubled relationship between the two countries, with the Russian Orthodox Church historically serving to strengthen Russia’s imperial authority over Ukraine. In recent years, religious ties played a central role in Putin’s efforts to prevent Ukraine from exiting the Russian sphere of influence. However, the Kremlin strongman is now discovering that a shared Orthodox faith does not mean Ukrainians necessarily embrace his vision of their country as part of a revived Russian Empire.\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine trace their national stories back to the tenth century and the early medieval Kyiv Rus state. The adoption of Christianity by Kyiv Prince Volodymyr the Great in 988 is regarded in Kyiv and Moscow alike as the starting point of their Orthodox identities. However, there is no agreement over the modern geopolitical implications of this ancient link.\n\nToday, the two countries remain overwhelmingly Orthodox. According to Pew Research Center data, 78% of Ukrainian adults and 71% of Russian adults identify as Orthodox believers. Nevertheless, the religious landscape is not quite as uniform as it might initially appear.\n\nUkraine’s Orthodox congregation is divided into a number of different dominations, with the two largest being the recently established Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the rival Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate, which is closely tied to the Russian Orthodox Church and has traditionally been seen as subservient to the Kremlin.\n\nSubscribe to UkraineAlert DAILY As the Russia crisis in Eastern Europe heats up, UkraineAlert DAILY delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight, from the UkraineAlert online publication and beyond, to your inbox Monday through Friday. Name First Last\n\nEmail *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nPutin has long sought to use the Russian Orthodox Church and its Ukrainian offshoot as soft power tools. These efforts received a major setback in early 2019 when the spiritual leader of the Orthodox World, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, granted the Orthodox Church of Ukraine independence (known as “autocephaly”). This was regarded as a momentous blow to Putin’s revanchist ambitions. In response, the Russian Orthodox Church officially cut ties with the Ecumenical Patriarch.\n\nDespite Russian frustration over the establishment of an independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine, Putin still seems to have genuinely believed many Ukrainian Orthodox believers would welcome his invasion. During a speech on the eve of the war, Putin spoke of the need to protect Russia’s “inalienable spiritual space” in Ukraine. This view has also been supported by the Russian Orthodox Church, which has repeatedly asserted that Ukraine is part of its spiritual territory.\n\nSince Russian tanks crossed into Ukraine on February 24, Putin has actively sought to portray the invasion as a righteous crusade that enjoys divine blessing. The Russian leader even quoted the Bible during a massive pro-war rally held in Moscow in mid-March. “And this is where the words from the Scriptures come to my mind: There is no greater love than if someone gives his soul for his friends,” Putin declared to large crowds in the Russian capital.\n\nSo far, the war has not gone according to plan. While Russian troops have encountered stiffer than expected opposition on the battlefield and been forced to retreat from northern Ukraine, Putin’s holy war for the souls of Ukraine’s Orthodox faithful has run into similar trouble.\n\nMany Ukrainians have been outraged by Russian Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Kirill’s open and frequently outspoken support for the war, which has included echoing Putin’s claims regarding Ukraine’s place within the so-called “Russian world.” Ukrainians have also been shocked and distressed to see the religious leader apparently bless the killing of Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nThis dismay has expressed itself in spiritual resistance that has rallied Ukraine’s fragmented Orthodox denominations. Metropolitan Onuphry, who heads the Moscow Patriarchate, has issued an unprecedented statement urging Putin to end the war. Meanwhile, more than 300 priests from his church are petitioning for Patriarch Kirill’s removal, something inconceivable just weeks ago. “It is impossible for us to remain in any form of canonical submission to the Patriarch of Moscow,” they now claim.\n\nA number of individual Ukrainian congregations have expressed their opposition to the Russian Orthodox Church’s pro-war stance by switching their allegiance from the Moscow Patriarchate to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.\n\nThe war has also impacted Orthodox communities beyond Ukraine. Russian Orthodox priests and deacons from around the world have publicly called on Patriarch Kirill to take a stronger peace stance. Some believers are leaving the Russian Orthodox Church altogether in protest, with numerous individual parishes defecting.\n\nOther Christian leaders have also expressed their alarm over the role of the Russian Orthodox Church in Putin’s war of aggression. The World Council of Churches is reportedly considering expelling the Russian Orthodox Church from its fellowship. Pope Francis has been particularly vocal in his appeals for peace and has recently cancelled plans for a June meeting with Patriarch Kirill in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has called on Kirill to help “end the violence in Ukraine.” His predecessor, Rowan Williams, who holds a deep appreciation for Eastern Christianity, has been significantly less diplomatic. Williams has pointedly criticized the Russian Orthodox Church and spoken of the “shocking, not to say blasphemous, absurdity of Orthodox Christians engaging in indiscriminate killing of the innocent.”\n\nFaith matters during times of war, especially in neighboring predominantly Orthodox countries like Russia and Ukraine with a deeply intertwined religious inheritance. As the current conflict evolves, it is increasingly clear that the messages reaching Russian and Ukrainian Orthodox congregations are strikingly different. This spiritual dimension will have a crucial impact on the ultimate outcome of the war and looks set to further deepen the divide that separates modern Russia and Ukraine.\n\nKnox Thames served in a special envoy role for religious minorities at the US Department of State during the Obama and Trump administrations.

                "body": "The ongoing war in Syria was supposed to be a crucible for the modern Russian war machine, reforming its operational capabilities in preparation for future conflicts. Now that Russia is facing a test of those skills in Ukraine, it is turning into a disaster that they should have seen coming.\n\nMoscow officially lost only 112 servicemen in six and a half years in Syria, compared to what it admits are 1,351 in a single month in Ukraine—the true numbers are likely to be far higher. And they have been forced to humiliatingly pull out around 40,000 troops from around Kyiv and Chernihiv having failed to make any significant progress in those regions and falling back to their old targets in eastern Ukraine. This raises the question of exactly what the Kremlin learned in Syria and, more importantly, what it should have learned but obviously has not.\n\nUnlike Ukraine, Syria’s cities would never be part of the Russian federation and could therefore be flattened. Meanwhile, its non-white population was framed as foreign terrorists. Jabhat al-Nusra fighters, ISIS, and hundreds of children were portrayed to the voters back home as equally fair targets. By contrast, Ukrainians are largely seen by the Russian public as Russians themselves or, at the very least, close cousins. These factors freed Russia up to use Syria as merely a means to an end, or more specifically, two ends.\n\nFirst, it used Syria as a proving ground to enhance command-and-control coordination. Like its Soviet predecessor, Russia's military is an artillery force with armored battalions and the ground-based nature of its power is not as fast nor flexible as air or naval forces, making such coordination critical. Not to mention, if such command coordination is achieved, then as the Institute for the Study of War’s lead Russia analyst, Mason Clark, wrote in a 2021 report, it “will erode one of the United States and NATO’s key technological advantages.”\n\nSecond, Moscow declared a withdrawal from Syria in March 2016, then again in January 2017, and again in December of that year. This wasn’t just a feint to get its enemies to lower their guard, it also helped prevent Russia from being pulled too deeply into the war, thus minimizing losses. But just as importantly, it broke the war into a series of campaigns, allowing Moscow to rotate its forces through Syria, giving them ample combat experience. As Michael Kofman, director of the Russia studies program at the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA), wrote in a 2020 report, “The entire Russian military must now serve [in Syria] in order to progress in rank.”\n\nAccording William Alberque, the director of strategy, technology and arms control at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), some of the lessons that were not learned well enough include use of drones for artillery spotting, the danger of MANPADS on the contested battlefield, and the need for secure supply lines. Each of these factors have proven devastating for Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\nBut the biggest lessons, he said, have been how to detect, disrupt, and destroy small groups of fighters, the importance of the destruction not just of suppression of enemy air defenses, the use of secure comms, the value of precision-guided missiles , and the benefit of drawing the enemy out rather than engaging in urban warfare.\n\nAlbuquerque added that Russia learned a few more things in Syria. Namely, “how to destroy cities, terror tactics to make civilians flee, and the use of proxies as holding forces/cannon fodder.”\n\nSo what went wrong? For one thing, Russia is one of the most corrupt nations in the world, and by far the most corrupt major power. Ruling a mafia state has its advantages if you’re the Godfather, but it’s hard to know who to trust. Moscow recently purged 150 Federal Security Service (FSB) agents and sent Sergei Beseda, the head of the FSB’s 5th Service, which handles intelligence in Ukraine, to Lefortovo Prison, which was used under Stalin to conduct torture-based interrogations and mass executions. One theory says Beseda gave information to the CIA, but the official reason, which may very well be true, is that he lied to the state and stole funds meant for espionage activities in Ukraine. If true, this means Putin’s own spy chiefs not only let him bring a knife to a gun fight—they sold off the combat blade and bought a cheap butter spreader.\n\nAnother thing that led Putin astray was his own over-confidence. Since taking office in 2000, he has been involved in six wars—Chechnya, Georgia, the North Caucasus, Syria, the Central African Republic (CAR), and Ukraine.All but the last have been victorious. Syria and the CAR are ongoing, but the preservation of Bashar al-Assad’s regime and Faustin-Archange Touadera’s administration represent strategic wins. Putin thought he couldn’t lose.\n\nCorruption and over-confidence prepared a path, but the biggest problem was Putin’s lack of experience ina war of this scale. Syria was a limited deployment in a far-off desert nation with minimal ground forces, Georgia only lasted 12 days, and Russia supported Touadera in the CAR from a distance with weapons, military instructors and Wagner mercenaries. Besides, even if Ukraine was the same game as Syria, and Russia could simply copy/paste its lessons, it still wouldn’t help since Moscow has apparently forgotten those lessons.\n\nRussia did apply its Syria lessons in Ukraine—but it did so in 2014, when it used Crimea to train a rapid-reaction professional force. Now, however, Moscow is running four combined arms headquarters independently with only partial management at the defense center in Moscow. Why? Partly because it’s not just propaganda when Putin talks about a “special military operation.” He truly believed the rest of Ukraine, like Crimea, would offer little resistance and that the war would only last a matter of days.\n\nIn Syria, says military historian Peter Caddick-Adams, “They were not up against a peer adversary—in fact they have never been: Afghan, Chechnya, Georgia, Syria—unlike in Ukraine. Syria was predominantly an air war, with little threat, so Russian pilots treated it more as range practice, dumping munitions on preselected targets” he told The Daily Beast.\n\n“Thus, what Russia did not learn from Syria was how to coordinate an all arms battle (artillery, armor, anti-tank, air defense, infantry, engineers, etc) at high tempo in complex terrain with aircraft of different types, helicopters, airborne and marine troops, with a well-balanced logistics and supply system—which is what they have needed for Ukraine.”\n\nHe added, “Russian communications are very lowbrow, and they are using unencrypted mobile phones in Ukraine, a bad habit picked up in Syria, where few opponents could understand Russian or had the technical competence to intercept.”\n\nSimply put, Russia’s PhD in desert warfare is making for a poor career in Ukraine. Indeed, few things have revolutionized the modern Russian military like the war in Syria, but nothing will affect it quite like Ukraine. One might even call this Russia's Vietnam moment. But one thing’s for certain, Russia looked at Ukraine and mistook a tiger for a cat. Now even if it decides to cut its losses and completely withdraw, it may not be so easy. As the old Chinese saying goes, when you’re riding a tiger, the hard part is getting off.",

(AP Photo/File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The United States unleashed some of its toughest actions against Russian President Vladimir Putin right after he rolled his troops into Ukraine . Polls in the U.S. find that people want Washington to do more. So what’s left, financially, diplomatically and militarily, to step up the pressure?\n\nThe U.S. could get strong results from any number of next steps, economists and current and former U.S. officials say. It could simply persist in pouring cash and potent weaponry into Ukraine — a likely course. It could even commit to shutting down some of the inroads the Kremlin has made into U.S. political and financial systems, also conceivable.\n\nBut the mightiest trigger the West can pull now on Russia, many experts agree, is the one on a gas pump nozzle. Cutting off Russian profits from oil and natural gas sales has become a main topic among world leaders looking at what else they can do to force Putin to end his invasion.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“It would be very useful to try to devise a way to reduce proceeds from those sales and that really is the proper objective, I think, of a ban,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told a meeting of world finance leaders Thursday.\n\n“But if we can think of a way to do that without harming the entire world from higher energy prices, that would be ideal,” Yellen said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden already has ended the relatively minor U.S. imports of Russian oil and other fossil fuel products. But the U.S. would be central if allies move to cut the global flow of Russian fuel and punish nations and businesses that fail to comply.\n\nGlobal purchases of Russian oil and gas production account for at least 40% of government revenue for Moscow. Exports are keeping Russia’s economy afloat despite the sanctions enacted so far and financing the war.\n\nCutting back further on Russian petroleum to the market would make a global supply crunch even worse, increasing prices for everyone, including in the United States.\n\nRepublicans already are making gas price increases that stem in part from Russia’s war a top campaign point against Biden.\n\n“Everybody wants a pain-free option, right?” asked Daniel Fried, a former assistant U.S. secretary of state for Europe, and one of many urging the U.S. to take tougher action as Russia builds forces for a new phase of attacks in Ukraine. “Yeah, they seldom exist.”\n\n“If anybody writes they can do this thing without some effect on gas prices, you know, without taking a hit — you’re crazy, because you can’t,” Fried said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe U.S. is already being asked to assure the world that U.S. producers can help make up for lost Russian supply, if Europe moves to cut the hose on Russian oil purchases quickly. The U.S. would likely be an administrator and enforcer in any secondary sanctions to penalize China or other nations or businesses if they buy from or enable Russia’s oil and gas industry.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said European nations have considered diverting their payments for Russian oil and gas into escrow accounts, similar to deals forced on Iran and Iraq as part of sanctions.\n\nA poll by The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that more than half of respondents want Biden to be tougher on Putin.\n\nPeople in the U.S. may just be coming around to accepting that doing that could mean financial hardships for them. By 51% to 45%, respondents in the AP-NORC poll said the U.S. should focus on sanctioning Russia as effectively as possible more than on limiting damage to the U.S. economy.\n\nBut ask Alan Gold of Potomac, Maryland, if he’s willing to pay more for gasoline as part of any global move to starve Russia of money for the Ukraine war, and the answer you get is a growl.\n\n“I’m paying $5 a gallon now,” Gold said this past week at a strip mall gas station, jerking his head at the price tally rolling upward as he pumped gas into his vehicle.\n\nElina Ribakova, deputy chief economist of the Institute of International Finance, said Russia’s war is boosting the price it gets for its oil and gas, driving the surplus in Russia’s current accounts to nearly $60 billion, a recent high despite all the West’s sanctions.\n\nEconomists and policymakers have to decide next steps as part of the larger context of militaries at war, the risks of nuclear war and the cost of Ukrainian lives, Ribakova told an online panel with Princeton’s Bendheim Center for Finance this past week. “This is the cost we’re thinking about when we think about sanctions ... not just about economics.”\n\nBarring major shifts, the financial realm is the one where the next major U.S. actions against Russia will come from.\n\nMilitarily, the U.S. is unlikely to send in many new, complex weapons systems, like U.S. tanks or fighter or bomber jets. Doing so would tie up Ukrainian fighters in training on unfamiliar weapons when they’re needed for fighting, by the Pentagon’s reasoning.\n\nInstead, the U.S. is expected to keep doing what it’s doing militarily, only more so, pumping in more cash and basic battlefield weapons and resupplies. On Thursday Biden pledged an additional $1.3 billion for heavy artillery, 144,000 rounds of ammunition and other aid.\n\nFurther boosting U.S. intelligence-sharing to help Ukraine in the fight is an option.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, the U.S. and likeminded nations are exploring ways Russia could be further isolated. Russia has already been suspended from the U.N. Human Rights Council and is facing a push at the world body’s educational, scientific and cultural organization to strip it of its UNESCO presidency and bar it from hosting a June meeting of its World Heritage Committee.\n\nRussia is unlikely to be suspended from the International Civil Aviation Organization, World Health Organization or Food and Agriculture Organization, however. Any attempt to remove it from the world body’s most powerful grouping – the U.N. Security Council – would fail on a Russian and likely Chinese veto.\n\nTalk of the U.S. officially designating Russia or Russian mercenaries as terrorists or supporters of terrorism hasn’t gained traction.\n\nThere is another big step the U.S. and its democratic allies should take, that doesn’t get as much attention, argues Alex Finley, a former officer of the CIA’s directorate of operations: Clean up their own act.\n\n“We need to examine our own role,” said Finley, who tracks seizures of Russian yachts and other Western penalties on Putin. She and others say lax regulation and enforcement in the West have allowed Putin and Russia to influence U.S. elections, park cash from corrupt enterprises in shell companies and offshore tax havens, and buy visas and passports to Western countries.\n\nIt’s all served to erode transparency and the rule of law in Western democracies, as Putin intended, said Finley.\n\nThe West got lax because “we made money with it,” Finley said. “But we did it in a way that we sold ... part of the soul of democracy.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Lee, Robert Burns and Fatima Hussein contributed from Washington.",

                "body": "Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine eight weeks ago, Americans—both news anchors and regular people—have been asking me the same question: When coffins of Russian soldiers start coming home, won’t Russians rise up against the war, and against Vladimir Putin? Won’t grieving Russian mothers go out into the streets to protest the senseless conflict that took the lives of their children?\n\nSetting aside the deeply patriarchal assumption embedded in the latter question—why is it the responsibility of women to end a war that men started without their input?—the whole idea has always struck me as impossibly solipsistic and naive. It assumes that everyone else, including Russians who live on the other side of the world and have their own history and culture, sees the world exactly as we do. It assumes that what is obvious to me and to most of us in the West—namely, that this is an unprovoked and unjustified war of Russian aggression—is obvious to the Russians themselves. It ignores the reality of what it is like not just to live in an authoritarian state with full control of the media, but to have lived in one for over two decades, an entire generation.\n\nMany of the Russian soldiers dying in Ukraine right now were born in and around 2000, the year Putin became president. They have known no president other than Putin, no system other than his, no truth other than the one his propaganda machine has fed them both in the classroom and through the media. It took Fox News and the right-wing media just one year to convince a majority of Republicans that Joe Biden didn’t really win the 2020 election, and that’s in a country with a free press, where other sources of information are easily and readily available. Now imagine what Fox News and Breitbart could do if they and their ilk were the only media outlets in the country—for twenty years.\n\nThis point of view also ignores what happened in the United States after the invasion of Iraq in 2003—or rather, what didn’t happen. When coffins draped in American flags began coming from Iraq, how many American mothers took to the streets? How many instead believed that their sons were heroes who died fighting for their country and the very idea of freedom? True, Americans made their discontent known at the ballot box, especially in the elections of 2006 and 2008, but a huge portion of the American public doubled down in its support for the Iraq war because to not support it was, in their view, to betray the American soldiers fighting it—and dying.\n\nIn other words, do we have higher expectations for Russians than we do for ourselves?\n\nEarlier this week, I listened to a podcast episode on Meduza, the independent Russian news site that has been my absolute go-to during this now eight-week war. The episode really caught my attention precisely because it captured these dynamics in Russia in a nuanced and poignant way. It featured Elena Trifonova and Olga Mutovina, the two founders of Lyudi Baikala, or “The People of the Baikal,” a publication focused on the two Russian regions that sandwich Lake Baikal, the deepest lake in the world. One of those regions, which flanks the lake on its eastern and southern shores, is called Buryatia. It is named after the Buryats, the indigenous, Mongolian people native to the republic and who lived there before the Cossacks arrived and before the area was annexed by the Russian tsars.\n\nBuryat soldiers have been essential to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. They began turning up in the Donbas shortly after Russia began an astroturf separatist war there in 2014. Because they look distinctly Asian, they were rather obvious evidence that the war wasn’t a spontaneous uprising by disgruntled ethnic Russians chafing at Kyiv’s rule, but a Russian military operation. Since the beginning of this phase of the war, which began on February 24, Buryatia has acquired the rather sad distinction of being the Russian region with the most reported combat deaths. In part, this is because Buryatia is an economically depressed region with few opportunities for young men. It is also part of a cruelly ironic dynamic: the people doing much of the fighting and dying in Ukraine are ethnic minorities—Chechens, Buryats, Dagestanis—who are viciously discriminated against in Russia. (It is also a sad echo of America’s war in Iraq, which was fought largely by minorities and poor people.)\n\nI was so taken by this episode that I quickly decided that, rather than just summarizing it for you, I should interview one of the founders of “The People of Baikal,” which has been keeping a running list of Buryatia’s casualties—the only such record in the republic—and which has been blocked inside Russia by the Kremlin’s media watchdog. My conversation with Olga Mutovina has been translated, condensed, and edited for clarity. I hope you find it as sad and moving as I did, and that it gives you some insight into why Russia’s mothers aren’t rising up against Vladimir Putin. (You can join me in supporting “The People of Baikal” here.)\n\nJulia Ioffe: Why are there so many residents of Buryatia among the dead in Ukraine?\n\nOlga Mutovina: Buryatia is one of the poorest regions of Russia. There isn’t a lot of work, there isn’t much industry, and the men mostly go elsewhere to work for stints—on oil rigs, in gold mines, some kind of extractive work. Or they can become contract soldiers. For young men, it provides some social mobility in a context where there’s nowhere to work and not much in the way of higher education. We spoke to some families of soldiers who had been killed and they told us that this wasn’t these soldiers’ first war. Many of them had already fought in Syria and, in 2014, Ukraine.\n\nUnlike [the neighboring] Irkutsk Oblast, which has oil and gas and lots of industry, Buryatia is a deeply [federally] subsidized region and so the amount of money that the region gets [from Moscow] is connected to how loyal its residents are, how they vote in elections, so people here mostly support the government. There isn’t much of a protest movement here.\n\nThe Buryat men who become contract soldiers are mostly from poor, rural families. We’ve spoken to many relatives who said that if there had been good work for their men, maybe they wouldn’t have signed up. Some of them come back from mandatory military service, try to establish themselves in civilian life, and then realize that they could earn a lot more in the army and they go back.\n\nWe spoke to one family [of a soldier who was killed in Ukraine] who said that he loved sports and working with children. He wanted to become a coach. But his salary was 7,000 rubles [$86] a month. He had a family to support: by the time he was killed, he had five children.\n\nHow much did he make in the military?\n\nPeople usually sidestep this question, but we’re told that a contract soldier makes about 40 to 50,000 rubles [about $500 to $600] per month. And now that they’re in combat, this salary is basically doubled.\n\nThere’s a hope here in the U.S. that, once more and more coffins start coming home to Russia, the mothers of these dead soldiers will protest or pressure the Kremlin to stop the war. Is that a reasonable hope?\n\nIt’s not just Americans who are hoping for this to happen. We also expected this to happen, that if there were combat deaths, the families would start asking questions and that some kind of discontent would ripen. Unfortunately, that hasn’t happened. This has been one of our biggest disappointments.\n\nWhy isn’t it happening?\n\nAt first, they published obituaries of these soldiers. Our local politicians issued statements about this or that person who had been killed. But when there were too many of these funerals, then they stopped saying anything and the government press stopped writing about it. Some of the journalists we know at these places told us that they were prohibited from publishing obituaries or writing anything about those killed. There’s a big athletic complex here in Ulan Ude [the capital of Buryatia] where people practice archery, which is the national sport here, and that’s where the military funerals are held. We did a survey where we asked people if they knew that there were now several funerals a week at the complex and only two people knew anything about it.\n\nWe also asked them what they thought of the special military operation—that’s what we call it in Russia—and they told us some absolutely incredible things. One young man told us that it was okay because [the dead soldiers] would simply be reborn. He was talking about the local Buddhist belief in reincarnation. That’s what I mean when I say that the support here for the government and the special operation is founded in tradition. These people are simply saying what the Buddhist lamas here say, and they say publicly that they support the war. There were lamas that went to Ukraine and held special prayer services and performed certain rituals [with the troops]. The lamas are directly participating in this.\n\nYou mentioned the people who work for state media who are banned from writing obituaries. Is it all explicit or do people already know that they should keep quiet?\n\nIt’s this all-encompassing learned helplessness. No one has any questions and no one has to explain anything. Everyone understands everything. You know, this really shocked me when I spoke to the mother of one soldier, a 19-year-old boy. I asked this mother if she had any questions for the authorities. And she said, “Who needs me and my questions?” That is, in this situation, where she’s lost everything, where a person should be screaming herself hoarse, she was silent. And most people are like this. They have no questions. It is this learned helplessness, this inertia: What can I do?\n\nWere there family members who said that these deaths were justified, that these young men were heroes?\n\nAlmost everyone we spoke to spoke in these terms. That 19-year-old boy I was telling you about, his aunt is a teacher in the elementary school and she was telling us that she’s already teaching her students about her nephew, using him as an example. She tells them that he’s a hero and that he died for his country. These are the phrases you hear at the [government] rallies, at the funerals where local officials speak—funerals where there are several coffins at once and which are basically turned into political rallies—and they use exactly this kind of language: These boys died for you and me. They are defending their country. They died so that there would be no bloodshed in our country. The family members of these soldiers hear all this at the funeral and I think it probably would be very painful to think that your child died for nothing. It’s a defense mechanism, to tell yourself that, “Yes, my child died, but it wasn’t in vain. He was a hero.”\n\nOne of my colleagues went to a tiny village that had lost people in every war: in World War II, in Afghanistan, in Chechnya, and already in this war. She spoke to one mother who lost a son in Chechnya [in the 1990s], and she said, “At first, I had doubts. I thought he had died for nothing. And then I was able to convince myself that he didn’t die for nothing. He died for his country.”\n\nIn the Meduza podcast, you said that families of fallen soldiers are instructed by the Russian military not to say anything, not to take photos at the funerals. Is the military actively intimidating family members?\n\nThings are so tense in the country right now that the military doesn’t even have to intimidate anyone. It’s enough just to hint at something and people understand everything themselves. They understand that they might not get the money [the government promised to families of fallen soldiers], that they might face unpleasant consequences. People are already so scared that a hint is enough. Here’s an example: we asked one colleague for the contacts of the family of one soldier who had been killed. The relatives immediately told the local representatives of the Defense Ministry, the Defense Ministry immediately called the local government, and the local government called the editor in chief of the publication where this journalist worked. That’s what we’re dealing with.\n\nThe thing that jumps out most to me is that most of the fighting and the dying for Putin’s idea of this pan-Slavic, Russky mir [“Russian world”] is being done by the ethnic minorities—Buryats, Chechens, Dagestanis—who are subjected to constant racism in Russia. How do you explain this?\n\nWe get this question most frequently from foreign journalists. Russian journalists don’t ask about this. We don’t think that this is a question of [Russian] nationalism. We think it’s for different reasons. Chechnya and Dagestan, for example, have warrior cultures. There are also a lot of soldiers coming from Cossack villages. These are cultures where people are used to holding weapons. There are many soldiers from Buryatia because it’s a very poor region that is very heavily subsidized by the government. The same is true of Tuva, which is even poorer than Buryatia. That’s how I explain it. Also, if you look at our list, you’ll see that half is Russian names and Russian faces [about half of Buryatia’s population identifies as Russian – JI].\n\nMaybe this is because I lived in Moscow for a few years, but I know how people there feel about people who have the “wrong” eye shape or the ugly names they call people from the Caucasus. And now these are the people defending the “Russian world.” You don’t see any irony in this?\n\nOf course there’s an absurdity in this, in the very concept of the Russky mir.\n\nDo the Buryats take note of this, though?\n\nOf course they do. When the head of the republic met with the local intelligentsia, the press secretary of the theater stood up and said, essentially, “When it comes to the honor guard at the eternal flame, they have tall, blue-eyed Russians, but when it comes to dying, they send the Buryats.” This created a lot of controversy and people shouted him down. This is a real question here. Maybe people are discussing this privately in their kitchens, but it’s not something that’s really discussed publicly.\n\nThese zinc coffins coming home, are they scaring young people off of joining the military?\n\nThis is another surprising discovery. It turns out it’s working in the opposite direction. We went to two villages that lost young men and where there’s now a big upswell of patriotism. The youth there are even more interested in the military and the war. The village I told you about, where the 19-year-old was from, his peers want to join the military and want to go fight. For those who are a bit younger, the town is buying rifles so they can do some target practice.\n\nThey’re not afraid they’ll be killed in battle?\n\nWe asked this question in the villages and it seems like they’re not really thinking about it. They’re young. Some were saying that they want to serve and are ready to die, like this young man from their village. What we do see is that the youth are really hungering for some kind of meaning, some kind of unifying idea. They want to aspire to something but there’s nothing for them. With these deaths, it seems like they’re finally getting some kind of meaning, some kind of idea they can live for. They’re proud of their fellow villager who was killed. When there’s no other meaning, the youth grab onto this. It’s very scary when people derive such meaning from such a horrific idea.\n\nSo we shouldn’t expect any protests, even if more coffins come back from Ukraine?\n\nOf course not. There won’t be any protests, not economic protests, not mothers’ protests, and the reason for this is very simple: the propaganda machine has been turned all the way up and it’s swallowing people whole. All the entertainment programs are gone. Now it’s either news of the war or talk shows about it, where the propagandists are methodically painting a picture for people that squelches any questions they might have: It’s all done by the Nazis, it’s all crisis actors, et cetera. It’s a very simple picture of the world. If you watch TV, you have no chance. Unfortunately, a lot of people watch TV here, even young people. It’s a very simple way to press a button and have everything explained to you.\n\nDo most people in Buryatia support the war? Or are they too scared to say otherwise?\n\nI think the majority supports it. We see it just based on our own little survey and how eager people were to say this to us on camera. We understand how traumatized the Ukrainian people are and what a huge tragedy this war is for them. But the Russian people are also being traumatized by it and supporting the military operation is likely a defense mechanism. Being on the winning team, being on the stronger side. It’s very uncomfortable to swim against the current, and it’s dangerous. It’s much safer to say that you support it.\n\nI don’t think that these people who are saying they support it in public are saying something else in private. I think people really do support it because it’s simpler. It’s much easier to sink into this comfort zone and never leave it because the truth is too horrible and hurts too much. If we realize that our country is the aggressor and that our nation is a pariah, if people who were taught for generations that the Russian soldier is always the liberator and only fights in just wars, if they learn that our soldiers did these horrific things, that they killed and raped and pillaged, that will be very unpleasant and painful. It’s much easier to shout from the rooftops that you support the special operation. I think our country has some very difficult work ahead to fully realize what we’ve done, that each individual bears some responsibility for this and has to repent for it. Without this, Russia can’t continue to exist.",

That’s a particular challenge during active hostilities and especially so in the case of Ukraine, given the sheer number, variety, scale, and geographic spread of the reported crimes, said Beatrice Godefroy, the Europe director at the Center for Civilians in Conflict. “The way you collect information—the level of detail, of granularity, for each and every incident—is very different in the context of Donbas 2021 than it is in the context of Kharkiv 2022,” she said, comparing data collection in a low-intensity conflict to the higher-intensity conflict going on now.\n\nBiden promised that such crimes will be prosecuted.

Russian troops retreating from the areas near Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Kharkiv left in their wake numerous reports of alleged war crimes.

The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine is collecting evidence via social media platforms such as Facebook, Viber, and Telegram, according to spokesperson Tanya Tesliuchenko, and Ukrainian NGOs such as Ukraine.5am are doing the same.\n\nBut there’s a downside to the loads of documentation and reporting available both through NGOs and videos uploaded onto social media, international criminal attorney Kip Hale said. “We have tons of crime-based evidence,” or documentary evidence showing a war crime, he said. But investigators have to verify that evidence, and they don’t have the manpower to sort through all of that documentation, 95 percent of which Hale estimates is “redundant.” And the crime-based evidence isn’t what will bring Putin and other high-ranking Russian officials to justice; evidence linking higher-ups to war crimes is much more difficult to come by.\n\nCrime-based evidence can help lead to this linkage evidence, though, Hale says; an investigator might interview Russian soldiers responsible for a war crime, which could lead to the most incriminating evidence—“his cell phone, his computer, any documents found on his person”—which might include an order to commit a war crime.\n\nCNN’s Barbara Starr tweeted on April 6 that a senior U.S. intelligence official believed the United States “will be able to identify the Russian units” that committed the atrocities in Bucha and that the intelligence community is prioritizing finding the units responsible for what appears to be the wholesale slaughter of civilians there. “I would just tell you, just looking at the imagery, when you see individuals with their hands tied behind their backs, and evidence of being shot in the head, that certainly appears to be premeditated, appears to be planned,” another defense official reportedly told Starr. Prosecuting the soldiers who directly commit war crimes and atrocities, the so-called trigger-pullers, “is easy,” Hale said, but that’s not the goal; the goal of a war crimes prosecution is to go after the person or people who set the policy “that when you implement that policy, that leads to crime.”\n\nBut finding the units responsible could lead higher up the chain of command, helping investigators and authorities to establish linkage evidence between atrocities like those seen at Bucha and more high-profile Russian officials. However, even those insider witnesses, should international authorities interview them, “are scared as shit … and may not know everything,” Hale said.\n\n“There are international and national mechanisms available right now with jurisdiction over those who bear individual criminal responsibility,” Jane Stromseth, an expert on post-conflict justice and accountability at Georgetown Law, said in remarks during the USIP panel in March. “I would highlight in particular the International Criminal Court and national proceedings in Ukraine and in other countries with jurisdiction.” As Stromseth noted, the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has already been to Ukraine, and the ICC’s investigative team has begun collecting evidence.\n\nBut, Stromseth said, the ICC will need international support—financial as well as logistical—to carry out an effective investigation and prosecution, and even then, there will be gaps in what the ICC can prosecute. Most notably, the ICC can’t prosecute the crime of aggression in this case, since neither Russia nor Ukraine is a party to the ICC. But, she insisted, there are ways to get around these hurdles, including a special tribunal for aggression and a “web of accountability,” involving national-level war crimes prosecutions, in addition to what the ICC itself brings forth.\n\nIn Ukraine itself, says Tetiana Pechonchyk, the head of Ukraine.5am, the criminal code isn’t specific enough to appropriately prosecute war crimes. For example, the rape of a civilian by a Russian soldier wouldn’t be tried in the context of conflict—“just simple rape,” she said. Making sure that Ukraine has the systemic capacity to appropriately try war crimes will be crucial, since Pechonchyk estimates that 90 percent of the war crimes and international human rights law violations committed during the war will be tried in Ukraine.\n\nEven assuming the ICC or the nations that have opened criminal investigations issue arrest warrants for those deemed responsible, they can still evade accountability. An arrest warrant issued by the ICC has no enforcement mechanism and depends on the cooperation of different nations’ authorities, and there are still many nations friendly enough with Putin that they could harbor war criminals. Plus, they would be safe enough in Russia itself—assuming Putin stays in power and decides he wants to protect them.\n\nIf arrested, any of the responsible parties could be tried in Ukraine, one of the nations that has opened a criminal case, or by the ICC, which “has jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute individuals responsible for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide committed on the territory of Ukraine,” Stromseth said. Ukraine reaffirmed the ICC’s jurisdiction there in 2015, so even nationals of states that don’t recognize ICC jurisdiction—such as Russia—can be prosecuted for the kinds of crimes Russia is alleged to have committed in Bucha and likely elsewhere in Ukraine.\n\nThough there is significant global attention on Russia’s alleged war crimes, and even an appetite to go after Putin himself, as Foreign Policy’s Colum Lynch noted in March, that’s not a guarantee that he’ll be prosecuted. As Hale put it, “They can throw the book at Putin, but how do you execute that arrest warrant?” It also runs the risk of politicizing the ICC or at least giving the appearance that the nations calling for Putin’s prosecution are doing so to enable regime change in Russia. Regardless of whether or not that’s actually happening, the appearance of Western politicians such as Biden calling for Putin to be prosecuted for war crimes—without reckoning with how challenging that process would be—puts the ICC in a difficult position.\n\nDespite some notable convictions for war crimes—including former Liberian President Charles Taylor, who was convicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and two former members of the Syrian security services, who were tried not by the ICC but by Germany—Hale estimated that there’s “less than a 1 percent chance of total accountability” in any given atrocity crimes case; the Nuremberg trials of participants in the Holocaust probably came the closest, he said. And the likelihood that some or most perpetrators of atrocity crimes will get away with it incentivizes continued, increased criminal behavior, as Stromseth noted in March.\n\n“Putin’s past aggressive acts and atrocities in Ukraine and elsewhere only emboldened him. And that impunity has to stop,” she said, evoking the atrocities that Russia enacted or enabled in Chechnya and Syria. When perpetrators of atrocity crimes aren’t brought to justice, Chatterji said, “the memory of mass violence against subjugated communities and lack of justice creates turbulent conditions under which further violence against those already brutalized appears inevitable.”\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that there’s no statute of limitation for war crimes, and it’s possible that investigators will uncover strong enough evidence to connect high-level Kremlin officials, or Putin himself, to the horrors Ukrainians are suffering right now. It’s also possible that geopolitical conditions could change in such a way as to make those responsible vulnerable to international enforcement mechanisms. But even if all of those conditions align, justice is a long way off, Pechonchyk said: “We understand that this will take years.”",

                "body": "An expert on Eastern and Central Europe discusses the direction of the war in Ukraine, including the likelihood of Russia’s using biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons.\n\nVladimir Putin “made a tragic mistake,” by embarking on war with Ukraine, says Randall Stone, a political science professor and the chair of the Department of Political Science at the University of Rochester .\n\nAt the same time, Stone, an expert on Russian and Eastern European politics who serves as the director of the University’s Skalny Center for Polish and Central European Studies, stresses that the West must be careful to avoid escalation; in particular, NATO must not send air forces into Ukraine.\n\n“It appears credible that Putin would be willing to escalate,” he said in an interview in April. “Why? Because he was willing to take the risk of the invasion in the first place. He has chosen to put himself in a position where if we intervened, he loses, and probably loses everything, not just Ukraine, but his regime, maybe his life.”\n\nQ&A with Randall Stone\n\nPutin is shifting his military focus to eastern Ukraine. Why?\n\nPutin is looking for something that he can sell as a success as the war in Ukraine is not going the way he expected.\n\nStone: Most observers agree that in order to end the conflict, Putin has to gain something that he can sell as a success at home. He no longer thinks Russia is going to take Kyiv, or any other major cities in Ukraine, but that he might be able to cut off a large portion of the Ukrainian army, which is currently arrayed in the East against the Donbas area.\n\nThis could be a tactical victory that would allow him to enforce a territorial settlement, which would expand the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk—which Putin declared “independent” a few weeks ago—to include the entire administrative areas of Donbas and Luhansk. Perhaps that’s something that he could sell as a victory at home.\n\nWhile Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has signaled willingness to compromise on NATO membership and possibly agree to Ukraine’s neutrality in return for a form of multilateral security guarantee, Zelensky has stood firm against demands to give up Ukrainian territory.\n\nI really think a decisive victory for Russia seems impossible at this point. Conversely, the eventual collapse of the Russian military seems possible amid signs of real structural weakness in the Russian army. And let’s not forget popular unrest in Russia, which could become another solution to the crisis.\n\nWhat are Putin’s biggest mistakes in this crisis?\n\n“What was supposed to be a relatively easy military operation for Russia has turned into a quagmire, which could lead to popular unrest that directly threatens Putin’s regime.”\n\nStone: Until February 24 Putin seemed highly unlikely to be dislodged from power any time soon. He had solid control over all the ministries in Moscow, which were run by his former KGB cronies, and there was no strong opposition to his rule. Most Russians receive their news from Russian television, which has been under strict state control for years. In short, he was very politically secure, but this could all now change with a defeat in Ukraine.\n\nAlready there are signs that many thousands of Russian troops have been killed and wounded in Ukraine. Credible estimates suggest that as many as 15,000 Russian soldiers may have died.\n\nAll this adds up to a very different kind of war from what Putin anticipated when he invaded on February 24. What was supposed to be a relatively easy military operation for Russia has turned into a quagmire, which could lead to popular unrest that directly threatens Putin’s regime.\n\nHow should the West respond?\n\nAmerica must avoid escalating the situation in order to avoid a nuclear war.\n\nStone: It is crucial for American foreign policy not to escalate the situation in a way that puts the United States and Russia in direct conflict, which would be extremely dangerous. We are dealing with a dictator who has his back up against the wall and who is going to be looking for any way out at this point. Turning this into a war with the West would be a way for Putin to shift the narrative away from the series of terrible mistakes that he has made. We must avoid giving him that opportunity and ensure that we don’t allow this war to become a nuclear exchange. Proposals to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which would involve US Air Force patrols in Ukrainian airspace, present a real danger of escalation that could lead to nuclear war. This is why the Biden administration has been careful to circumscribe US and NATO intervention in the conflict.\n\nHow likely is Russia to use biological or chemical weapons?\n\nThe use of biological and chemical weapons by Russia is unlikely.\n\nStone: Chemical and biological weapons are really not useful as military weapons; they’re effective means of terrorizing civilians. I think it’s highly unlikely that they would be deployed and, of course, the United States would not respond with chemical or biological weapons. In the past, the US has shown that it’s not willing to intervene to prevent the use of chemical weapons against civilians—as seen either in Iraq or in Syria.\n\nWhat role does nuclear deterrence play here?\n\nNuclear weapons are important but we need to distinguish between the functions of immediate versus extended deterrence.\n\nNuclear weapons are important in this scenario because we’re in a situation of extended deterrence. International relations scholars distinguish between immediate deterrence and extended deterrence.\n\nImmediate deterrence essentially means that I will use nuclear weapons against you if you use them against me. Throughout the Cold War, both sides assumed a posture of mutually assured destruction, which meant that one could be fairly certain that nuclear weapons would not be used because a nuclear exchange would have been disastrous for both sides.\n\n“ A decisive victory for Russia seems impossible at this point.”\n\nExtended deterrence is a bit more problematic. Extended deterrence means that I will use nuclear weapons to defend my ally, or to defend some specific objective.\n\nFor example, Russia announced a strategy of extended nuclear deterrence to protect Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis, while the US threatened extended nuclear deterrence to defend Western Europe from a possible Soviet attack during the Cold War. The Soviet Union never really intended to attack Western Europe, but this was the centerpiece of US strategic doctrine for 45 years.\n\nUnder what circumstances might Putin use nuclear weapons?\n\nIf NATO partners were to send air forces into Ukraine, Putin might use nuclear weapons.\n\nStone: Putin is using the idea of extended deterrence to prevent the US from intervening in a conventional war in Ukraine, and he has indicated that if NATO intervenes by sending its air force into Ukraine, the response would be a nuclear one.\n\nThe NATO air force is so much more powerful than the Russian that NATO would quickly prevail and Russia would not have any chance of winning the war under those circumstances. This would be so disastrous for Putin that he likely would be willing to escalate to a nuclear war to prevent it. The response would probably take the form of nuclear attacks against NATO air bases in Poland and Romania, and perhaps in other European countries.\n\nThis is why sending NATO planes has been off the table for NATO, because it appears credible that Putin would be willing to escalate. Why? Because he was willing to take the risk of the invasion in the first place. He has chosen to put himself in a position where if we intervened, he loses, and probably loses everything, not just Ukraine, but his regime, maybe his life.\n\nIf Putin is willing to risk that much, it seems likely that he has already decided that he is willing to take the next logical step, which would be nuclear war. He probably calculates that such a war could be kept limited, but of course that is an experiment that no one wants to run.\n\nRochester Explains: Ukraine and Russia\n\nWhy does Russia want Ukraine?

But the head of Russia's central bank contradicted Putin's assessment that same day, saying the full impact of the sanctions was yet to be felt.\n\nAccording to the assessments, reported by The Times, Putin questions the long-term resolve of the West and believes that with the help of China, India, and other Asian economies, he can avoid full international isolation and the worst consequences of Western sanctions.\n\nChina and India, which have not sided with or against Russia in the Ukraine war, have continued trading with Russia, thereby softening the blow of Western sanctions.\n\nPutin has also menaced the West with the potential use of force. On Wednesday, Russia tested its new intercontinental ballistic missile, dubbed \"Satan 2,\" which Putin said would \"provide food for thought to those who in the heat of frenzied aggressive rhetoric try to threaten our country.\"\n\nOne senior US intelligence official told the Times that Putin's isolation may prompt him to lash out at the West in unpredictable ways.\n\n\"We have been so successful in disconnecting Putin from the global system that he has even more incentive to disrupt it beyond Ukraine,\" the official said. \"And if he grows increasingly desperate, he may try things that don't seem rational.\"\n\nRussia has in recent days refocused its campaign in a renewed assault in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nKremlin insiders told Bloomberg in a Wednesday report that Putin was not listening from warnings about the political and economic cost of the conflict and regarded himself as being on an historic mission in waging war in Ukraine.",

                "body": "You must also have a sense of when to stop—Garry Kasparov, How Life Imitates Chess\n\nUkraine’s brilliant and tenacious resistance on land, as well as the sinking of the Moskva in the Black Sea, have checked Russia’s offensive in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin would be wise to follow the advice of his countryman, chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, and know when to stop. Instead, Putin appears intent on further escalation. In response to these events, Russia warned the United States to stop arming Ukraine, or face “unpredictable consequences.” Putin even went so far as to prescribe the weapons that the United States should not provide to the Ukrainian Army.\n\nAs Putin comes to terms with his looming defeat, he is now left with three bad, but not equally bad, options. The least bad Russian option is to sue for peace on the most favorable terms Ukraine will grant and end this pointless and reckless war. A worse option would be to go on the defensive in Eastern Ukraine and vainly hope for a more favorable correlation of forces in the future. The worst option of all would be for Russia to attempt another offensive, gambling the entire army in Ukraine on one last thrust with no hope of success. The West, in considering its responses to these actions, would do well to remember Napoleon’s advice (more or less): “Never interfere with an enemy in the process of destroying himself.”\n\nLeast Bad: Sue for Peace\n\nRussia has not only lost the war in Ukraine, but is at risk of creating the very encirclement this war aimed to prevent. The United States and other NATO allies are pouring guns and money into Ukraine at breakneck speed. Ukraine is more fully integrated in the West than ever before. NATO is moving to strengthen its eastern flank, and many NATO members, most notably Germany, have committed to substantial increases in defense spending, Finland and Sweden are considering applying for NATO membership. Economic sanctions on Russia are not only holding, but growing: the European Union is considering banning Russian oil imports.\n\nFaced with such a dire situation, Russia’s wisest move would be to sue for a peace that restores the status quo ante. In exchange for withdrawing its forces to their pre-invasion positions of February, Russia could ask Ukraine to recognize the independence of the Donbas region. This move might fracture the thus far rock-solid coalition against Russia, and prevent the fatal blow threatened by a European embargo on oil imports. Such a move might also shore up weakening support for Russia on the world stage, most notably in India and China. Putin could justify this retreat by characterizing its invasion as a successful punitive expedition in response to Ukraine’s (largely imagined) offenses.\n\nWhile wise, this option is also unlikely. A Russian retreat and restoration of the status quo ante will be seen both at home and abroad for what it is: a defeat for the Putin regime. Like previous Russian autocrats, Putin fears his real domestic enemies far more than his imagined foreign foes. The oligarchs, generals, and spies he relies on to remain in power might reasonably conclude that his head is a small price to pay to ameliorate Russia’s suffering. Putin, a spy who took power from a frail and faltering Boris Yeltsin, understands these calculations all too well.\n\nWorse: Defend the Donbas and Hope for Better Days\n\nIf Putin cannot end the war without losing his head, he might conclude that he can live to fight another day by going on the defensive in eastern Ukraine. Under this option, Putin would not seek any formal end to hostilities requiring Ukrainian assent. Instead, he would merely reposition his forces on defensible terrain in an attempt to hold the ground he already had before February. Putin might then adopt the maximalist aim of building sufficient combat power to resume offensive operations at some point in the future. Alternatively, he might adopt the more modest aim of transforming a ceasefire into yet another frozen conflict stuck in the netherworld between war and peace.\n\nThis strategy is doomed to failure because time is not on Putin’s side. Ukrainian nationalism and Ukrainian arms are stronger now than at the outset of the conflict, and grow stronger with each passing day. The correlation of forces has shifted decisively in Ukraine’s favor, thanks both to a surprisingly effective domestic arms industry as well as generous Western aid. Meanwhile, Russia’s military and economic position continues to weaken. On the battlefield, the Russian forces have reportedly lost more than 20,000 troops, 460 tanks, and 300 aircraft. On the home front, Western sanctions are pushing Moscow to the brink of financial default on its Western loans. Putin cannot play for time because he hasn’t any: each passing day brings new losses on the battlefield, and diminished resources at home to replace those losses.\n\nDespite the futility of this strategy, it is the one that he will most likely adopt. Putin has isolated himself from advisors willing to tell him the truth, and this strategy allows him to remain in denial for a little while longer. His final defeat will come more slowly, but no less inevitably.\n\nWorst: One Last Gamble\n\nThe most reckless option of all would be for Putin to attempt a final offensive to attempt to reverse the fortunes of this most unfortunate war. In this fever dream masquerading as a strategy, Putin would marshal his forces for a counterattack to cut Ukraine off from the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. Such an offensive would require the final destruction of Mariupol, already well under way. Putin would hope to limit Western assistance to Ukraine through disinformation and nuclear bluster.\n\nThe absurdity of this strategy is plain on its face. Russia didn’t have the troops, tanks, and aircraft to accomplish this objective when its military and economy were at full strength. After a month of horrific battlefield losses, it has far less. Russia’s fragile logistics system was incapable of sustaining its forces at the outset of the war, and is certainly incapable of replacing battlefield losses to support a renewed offensive. The West wasn’t cowed by Putin’s bluffs when many believed the Russian Army was a juggernaut. That Army now stands revealed as an empty shell, and Putin’s bluffs are less credible than ever.\n\nThis reckless strategy would be the most dangerous option not for Ukraine or other Western states, but for Putin himself. The approach is reminiscent of the Ludendorff offensive at the end of World War I. Faced with horrific losses on the battlefield and growing discontent at home, Germany gambled everything on one last attack on the West under the leadership of Field Marshal Erich von Ludendorff. While achieving some initial tactical success, this operation failed because Germany had neither the logistics nor the manpower to sustain the attack. The war ended with the disintegration of the Germany Army and the toppling of the German government.\n\nThe Western Response: We Can Do This All Day\n\nNo matter which option Putin chooses, the Western response should be the same: aid the Ukrainian military, relieve the suffering of the Ukrainian people, maintain the unity of the NATO alliance, and increase the military and economic costs of Russia’s continued aggression. The only elements that need to vary are the emphasis and pace of those efforts. If Putin opts for peace, the West must maintain diplomatic, economic, and military solidarity to ensure Ukraine receives the most favorable settlement possible. If he opts for defense, the West must continue its efforts to strengthen Ukraine and isolate Russia to reveal the futility of playing for time. Finally, if he opts for offense, the West must surge every form of support to Ukraine to discredit Russia’s imperial delusions fully and finally.\n\nIn his recent démarche to the U.S. demanding an end to military support for Ukraine, Putin has helpfully provided a list of those capabilities Russia most fears. The U.S. should treat this message not as a Russian ultimatum but rather as a Ukrainian shopping list. When Russia launches artillery strikes at civilian populations, the West should send Ukraine Multiple Launch Rocket Systems and counter battery radars. When Russia uses aircraft in a reckless and vain offensive, the West should redouble shipments of Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and add the Patriot Surface-to-Air Missile System to the mix. When Russia dispatches its remaining tanks on a final, suicidal attack, the West should not only further accelerate shipment of Javelin and Switchblade anti-tank systems, but also begin arming Ukraine with M1 Abrams main battle tanks and other maneuver capabilities to drive Russia from Ukrainian soil once and for all. These weapons shipments are the clearest form of diplomacy, communicating to Putin that we can do this all day.\n\nVladimir Putin is in the process of destroying himself, and every day that passes, and every arms shipment that arrives in Ukraine, makes that outcome more inevitable.\n\nJohn Nagl is a retired Army officer who teaches at the Army War College.

I don't have any doubt at all.\"\n\nRussia will \"rhythmically and calmly\" continue its operation but the most important strategic conclusion was that the unipolar international order which the United States had built after the Cold War was breaking up, Putin said.\n\nPutin said Russia had no choice but to fight because it had to defend the Russian speakers of eastern Ukraine and prevent its former Soviet neighbour from becoming an anti-Russian springboard for Moscow's enemies.\n\nThe West has condemned the war as a brutal imperial-style land grab targeting a sovereign country. Ukraine says it is fighting for its survival after Putin annexed Crimea in 2014 and on Feb. 21 recognised two of its rebel regions as sovereign.\n\nPutin dismissed the West's sanctions, which have tipped Russia towards its worst recession since the years following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, as a failure.\n\n\"That Blitzkrieg on which our foes were counting did not work,\" Putin said. \"The United States is ready to fight with Russia until the last Ukrainian - that is the way it is.\"\n\nPutin, who had been ubiquitous on Russian television in the early days of the war, had largely retreated from public view since Russia's withdrawal from northern Ukraine two weeks ago.\n\nHis only public appearance in the past week was at the funeral of a nationalist lawmaker, where he did not directly address the war. On Monday he met the visiting chancellor of Austria at a country residence outside Moscow but no images of that meeting were released.\n\nPutin dismissed Ukrainian and Western claims that Russia had committed war crimes as fakes.\n\nSince Russian troops withdrew from towns and villages around the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Ukrainian troops have been showing journalists corpses of what they say are civilians killed by Russian forces, destroyed houses and burnt-out cars.\n\nReuters saw dead bodies in the town of Bucha but could not independently verify who was responsible for the killings. Ukraine says Russia is guilty of genocide and U.S. President Joe Biden has accused Putin of war crimes and called for a trial.\n\nPutin said he had told Western leaders to think a little about destruction by the United States of the Syrian city of Raqqa, the former de facto capital of the Islamic State caliphate, and in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Have you seen how this Syrian city was turned to rubble by American aircraft? Corpses lay in the ruins for months decomposing,\" Putin said. \"Nobody cared. No one even noticed.\"\n\n\"There was no such silence when provocations were staged in Syria, when they portrayed the use of chemical weapons by the Assad government.

                "body": "Despite throwing the full force of Russian might against Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin still hasn’t toppled the country. His troops have run out of fuel, gone short on supplies, and some soldiers have even left the battlefield rather than kill their brother Slavs. Instead of dividing NATO and capturing Kyiv, Putin has united the world behind an unlikely Ukrainian hero, the former-comic-turned-president Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBeing caught in a checkmate is an unconscionable position for the judo-loving masterspy. Unable to change the dynamics on the battlefield or accept defeat, he is likely mulling his nuclear trump card option.\n\nIndeed, on April 15, Zelensky announced that the world should “be ready” for the possibility that Putin will use nuclear weapons in Ukraine — a concern shared by CIA Director William Burns. On Wednesday, Russia tested a new intercontinental missile, nicknamed Satan II, which, Putin said, should “force all who are trying to threaten our country in the heat of frenzied, aggressive rhetoric to think twice.”\n\nBack during the Yugoslavian War, Putin and his Russian General Staff first developed a “limited nuclear war” plan called the “escalate-to-de-escalate” strategy. By crossing the nuclear threshold, the theory goes, Russia would shock the adversary into abandoning the fight and settling for peace.\n\nThe testing of a new intercontinental missile should “force all who are trying to threaten our country in the heat of frenzied, aggressive rhetoric to think twice,” Putin said. Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIf Putin were to deploy such a weapon in Ukraine, it would likely be a sub-kiloton warhead that would produce a blast roughly a third of the size of Hiroshima with a small atomic fall out. By detonating a “small” nuke in Ukraine — rather than the kind of Armageddon-inflicting ICBMs that Russia and the United States continue to point at each other — the Russian strongman believes he could stave off intervention from the West.\n\nRussia would not dare target the American homeland with nuclear strikes, unless they assess that the United States plans to decapitate the Moscow regime.\n\nEarlier this month, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said the world should “be ready” for Russia using nuclear weapons in his country. AFP via Getty Images\n\nAnd yet, Russia holds the trump card in that fight: the world’s most formidable arsenal of nuclear weapons, with a ten-to-one advantage over the US in tactical atomic stockpile. Scariest of all, Moscow has a Doomsday Device, called Perimeter — and dubbed “Dead Hand” by the West — which reportedly can destroy the US homeland in 30 minutes.\n\nThis highly complex system is designed for a retaliatory strike, following an initial attack on Russia by the US. Designed by the Soviets at the height of the Cold War, if switched on, it would launch Russia’s entire nuclear arsenal directly at this country. The system remains semi-dormant until activated by a high-ranking official in a crisis.\n\nA woman cries over scenes of carnage in Mariupol, which has been devastated by the Ukraine-Russia conflict. REUTERS\n\nIf activated, it can still launch even if the Russian regime is wiped out and Putin or his alternates are unable to authorize a nuclear strike through a standard process. After the initial multi-step verification that communication links to Putin’s war room are not working, in about 15-60 minutes, the autonomous computerized system would send signals to nuclear weapons silos, directing all remaining Russian nuclear missiles to launch.\n\nNow, Putin is ratcheting up his rhetoric, using the unspoken threat of Dead Hand against the US. When he first attacked Ukraine on Feb. 24, he warned that the countries who intervened would face “consequences you have never seen.” Three days later, he raised the status of Russia’s nuclear forces to “special combat readiness,” the nuclear posture that Moscow maintains today.\n\nInside the opened silo of a Russian intercontinental ballistic Topol-M missile. The country’s so-called “Dead Hand” system reportedly has the ability to launch all of Russia’s nuclear weapons at the US homeland at once. ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOn March 22, after a CNN journalist asked Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov whether Russia would resort to using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Peskov answered that Russia’s nuclear capability can be used in the event of an “existential threat.” Some analysts at the time understood that the probability of this happening was low because Ukraine is massively outmatched by Russia’s military.\n\nPresident Biden’s speech in Poland, where he said Putin “cannot remain in power,” sparked Putin’s press secretary to declare that Russia and the West “have entered the phase of total war.” AP\n\nBut on March 28, two days after Joe Biden declared in Poland that Putin “cannot remain in power,” Peskov told PBS that Russia and the West “have entered the phase of total war.” He accused countries, including the United States, Canada and Australia, of “leading war” against Russia “in trade, in economy,” in “seizing properties,” in “seizing funds,” in “blocking financial relations.” Whether a gaffe or a Freudian slip, Biden’s call for a regime change in Russia, in the middle of an active armed conflict, checked off Moscow’s “existential threat” requirement for the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nNow finding himself cornered in an unwinnable position, Putin is invoking the concepts of “total war” and an “existential threat” to keep the US and NATO out of the conflict. Meanwhile, the May 9 anniversary of Russia’s defeat of Nazi Germany approaches, a date that is driving Putin to launch an even greater offensive to declare victory in Ukraine.\n\nThese intercontinental ballistic missile systems are headed to a temporary ground in Moscow for the country’s annual parade on “Victory Day,” celebrating Russia’s defeat of Nazi Germany.

                "body": "One of the silver linings of the very large dark cloud of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is the clarity it provides. This is, broadly speaking, a contest between good guys and bad guys.\n\nA lot of people who fancy themselves foreign-policy realists roll their eyes at talk about “good guys” vs. “bad guys.” The world is made up of nation states with interests and those states act rationally on their interests. Good and bad ain’t got nothing to do with it.\n\nI’ve never bought this argument, on either analytical or moral terms.\n\nYes, nations have interests, but the way they define their interests is not always strictly rational. History is full of examples of nations committing vast resources to causes that are extra-rational. “The mistake of the ‘realists’ is not their interest in the struggle for power but their deliberate neglect of everything else, especially the non-scientific, contingent, very human feelings and beliefs that most powerfully move people,” the late, great Donald Kagan wrote in “Honor Among Nations: Intangible Interests and Foreign Policy.”\n\nTo claim that, say, North Korea’s foreign and domestic policy is simply an expression of its rational self-interest is to declare you don’t know anything about North Korea — or the decisions its rulers chose to make in turning that society into a xenophobic gulag.\n\nRealists tend to conflate the interests of rulers with the interests of the ruled. It’s hard to find a sane analyst who argues that Putin invaded Ukraine solely in the name of Russia’s rational self-interest rather than his own notions of glory and historical retribution, and it’s even harder to find one who thinks the invasion is objectively in the interest of the Russian people.\n\nAgain, while it would have been in everyone’s interest — however you define it — for Putin not to have committed this monstrous crime, his choice makes it easy to call him and his enablers the bad guys. Deliberately targeting civilians, sanctioning mass executions and rape, not to mention the intentional wholesale erasure of cities, is objectively evil. The Russian state tacitly admits this when it refuses to tell its own people what it is doing.\n\nA man walks by destroyed buildings in the southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine on April 22, 2022. REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko\n\nIndeed, the scope of Russia’s lies is so great that the liars are starting to say the quiet part out loud: that truth and truth-telling is an impermissible threat to the Russian regime.\n\nMargarita Simonyan, the head of RT (formerly Russia Today), which once claimed to be a legitimate news organization, recently declared, “No big nation can exist without control over information” and that Russia should follow the Soviet or contemporary Chinese model, which would deny people freedom in “the political life of their country, in the informational life of the country.” With media voices like Simonyan in charge, it’s no wonder Putin allegedly polls well in Russia.\n\nThere’s equal clarity for the United States. I think the realist case for doing everything possible to assure a Russian defeat is obvious. It is Russian policy to undermine our interests and the interests of our allies around the world.\n\nMargarita Simonyan is the head of RT and recently said, “No big nation can exist without control over information.” REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina/File\n\nBut there’s a deeper moral realism involved. In the 1990s, we pushed Ukraine to relinquish its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees. In 2005, a bipartisan effort led by Sens. Dick Lugar and Barack Obama resulted in Ukraine destroying vast amounts of its conventional weapons, on the assumption that those security guarantees would be honored. In other words, we told them we’d have their back.\n\nPutin said those guarantees — which Russia signed on to — were null and void because the Ukrainian Euromaidan protests in 2013 ushered in a new Ukrainian state. Whether you buy that garbage is immaterial; Putin’s betrayal of his commitments doesn’t release us from ours. And it is in our interest to be seen as a nation that honors its commitments, both moral and legal.\n\nNone of this is to say we should send our own troops into Ukraine — not that we wouldn’t be morally justified. Igniting a direct war between two nuclear superpowers is a bad idea. Besides, Ukraine isn’t asking for that. It is asking for the modern equivalent of the arsenal of democracy, and we should give it to them, fast. Because Putin is now doubling down on his crimes in eastern Ukraine just to save face. It’s not in our interest that he succeed. And, as the bad guy, he deserves to lose.\n\nTwitter: @JonahDispatch",

'You have simply no idea what it means for us to simply eat, drink some sweetened tea.

                "body": "Advertisement\n\nWarring Russian President Vladimir Putin has today launched a search for British SAS forces alleged to be fighting in western Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin's Investigative Committee (IC), often referred to as Putin's personal CIA, said Saturday it will look into 'the facts of the activities of British SAS saboteurs in Ukrainian regions,' in particular Lviv, according to state-controlled outlet RIA Novosti.\n\nIt comes as Kremlin-backed soldiers encircle the last remaining defenders of Mariupol to the east, with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky vowing to pull out of peace talks with Russia if any of his soldiers are killed in the last stand in the strategic port city.\n\nHe also said he was 'satisfied' with the military aid coming from the UK, just hours before prime minister Boris Johnson announced 'further military aid', including more armoured vehicles, in a series of tweets on Saturday evening.\n\nMeanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will travel to Kyiv on Sunday and hold talks with Zelensky to discuss the kinds of weapons he needs to fight off Russia - who said it would deploy its new intercontinental nuclear weapon - the Sarmat, aka 'Satan II' - by the autumn.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the IC claimed that 'at least two groups of specialists in sabotage and guerrilla warfare from the British Special Air Service (SAS) have been sent to the Lviv region'.\n\nAn IC source claimed SAS operatives in Ukraine 'are specialists in sabotage and partisan activities, recruiting and training agents to work in hostile territory'.\n\nRussia appears to base its investigation on information allegedly received from captured Ukrainian troops.\n\nPutin confers with the head of the Kremlin's Investigation Committee (and his old university classmate) Alexander Bastrykin, who believes SAS forces may be fighting in the western region of Lviv\n\nBastrykin's Investigative Committee said it heard reports of British 'saboteurs' in Lviv\n\nThe SAS is 'considered one of the most highly qualified in the world in organising coups d'etat, mass protest rallies, contract killings of political figures, recruiting agents, including those in the highest echelons of power, and preparing terrorist attacks', said the RIA Novosti report.\n\n'This is no ordinary special force - these are intellectuals, in each group there is always an ideologist, you can say a professor, and the rest are particular specialists,' said a Russian law enforcement source.\n\nThe report claimed that the SAS often work in war zones under cover of medical workers.\n\n'With a high degree of probability, these specialists arrived in order to improve the skills and efficiency of the Ukrainian special services in coordinating the activities of sabotage groups in the territories of Ukraine controlled by Russian troops,' said the IC source.\n\nSAS forces conduct a specialised military maneouvre in an undisclosed location (file image)\n\nSAS soldiers fighting in the desert in 1996. The service is widely considered the world's best\n\nRussia will deploy 'Satan 2' nuclear missiles 'capable of destroying the UK' this autumn in 'historic' weapons upgrade following recent test The Sarmat missile (pictured in test launch) is said to be the world's longest-range intercontinental ballistic missile, capable of striking a target 11,200 miles away - meaning it could easily strike targets in the US and Europe. Vladimir Putin's regime has announced it will deploy the fearsome nuclear-capable 'Satan II' missile it recently tested in a show of strength by autumn, in a further ratcheting of tensions between Russia and the West as Moscow redoubles its brutal war on Ukraine. The Sarmat missile is said to be the world's longest-range intercontinental ballistic missile, capable of striking a target 11,200 miles away - meaning it could easily strike targets in the US and Europe. Western military experts said the Sarmat is capable of carrying 10 or more nuclear warheads and decoys - easily enough to wipe out territories the size of Britain or France in a single strike. However, analysts believe the target revealed by Dmitry Rogozin, head of Putin's Roscosmos space agency, is an ambitious one because Moscow reported its first test-launch only on Wednesday and more tests will be needed before the missile can be deployed. This week's test, after years of delays due to funding and technical issues, marks a show of strength by Russia at a time when the war in Ukraine has sent tensions with the US and its allies soaring to their highest levels since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Rogozin said in an interview with Russian state TV that the missiles would be deployed with a unit in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, about 1,860 miles east of Moscow. He said they would be placed at the same sites and in the same silos as the Soviet-era Voyevoda missiles they are replacing, something that would save 'colossal resources and time'. The launch of the 'super-weapon' was an historic event that would guarantee the security of Russia's children and grandchildren for the next 30-40 years, Rogozin added. Western concern at the risk of nuclear war has increased since Putin launched his illegal and brutal invasion of Ukraine on February 24. When the Russian tyrant burst into the former Soviet state, he made a reference to his nation's nuclear deterrents, warning the West that any major intervention would 'lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history'. Last month United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned: 'The prospect of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of possibility.' Putin described the launch of the nuclear-capable RS-28 Sarmat as a 'big, significant event' for Russia's military and claimed the weapon can overcome all modern defence systems. However the US described the testing as 'routine' and dismissed any global threat.

More footage shows black smoke billowing into the sky shortly after the apartment buildings were hit by the missiles.\n\nYermak wrote of the Russian attack: 'These are only those who were found. And most likely, there will be more. A child who had to celebrate his first Easter with his parents. Nothing is sacred. Evil will be punished.'\n\nMany Ukrainians celebrate Easter according to the Julian calendar, with Easter Sunday falling this year on April 24.\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's interior minister, said: 'Residents of the city heard explosions in different areas.\n\n'Residential buildings were hit. It is already known about one victim. He burned in his car in a courtyard of one of the buildings.'\n\nIt comes as Russia resumed its assault on the last Ukrainian defenders holed up in a giant steel works in Mariupol, a Ukrainian official said, days after Moscow declared victory in the southern port city and said its forces did not need to take the factory.\n\n'The enemy is trying to strangle the final resistance of the defenders of Mariupol in the Azovstal area,' Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said on national television.\n\nThe fate of the Ukrainians holed up in the sprawling seaside steel mill wasn't immediately clear; earlier Saturday, a Ukrainian military unit released a video reportedly taken two days earlier in which women and children holed up underground, some for as long as two months, said they longed to see the sun.\n\n'We want to see peaceful skies, we want to breathe in fresh air,' one woman in the video said. 'You have simply no idea what it means for us to simply eat, drink some sweetened tea. For us, it is already happiness.'\n\nThe complex was the last bastion of Ukrainian resistance in the port city but Putin has ordered his forces to completely block it off, 'so even a fly cannot escape'.\n\nSoldiers and civilians trapped inside have no food or water and Ukraine's foreign ministry is desperately appealing for an evacuation route to get them to safety.\n\nHowever, a new attempt to evacuate Ukrainian civilians from the war-torn city failed on Saturday, an aide to the city's mayor said, blaming Russian forces. The official said 200 residents of Mariupol had gathered to be evacuated, but that the Russian military told them to disperse and warned of possible shelling.\n\nAs the battle for shattered Mariupol ground on, Russia claimed it had taken control of several villages elsewhere in the eastern Donbas region and destroyed 11 military Ukrainian military targets overnight, including three artillery warehouses.\n\nThe head of the Ukrainian President's office says five people have been killed and 18 wounded in a missile strike on Odessa (Pictured: High-rise apartment block bellows thick black smoke after being struck by Putin's missiles in Odessa on Saturday)\n\nThousands of civilians face starving to death in captured Mariupol after Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to seal shut the Azovstal steelworks (Pictured: Graphic shows how Russian troops have surrounded the Azovstal steelworks, where thousands are hiding underground in its complex network of bunkers)\n\nThe Russian army has taken control of Ukraine's besieged port city of Mariupol except for the Azovstal plant (pictured Friday), which is housing thousands of civilians and soldiers in its underground tunnels and bunkers.\n\nMariupol has taken on outsize importance in the war.

(Pictured: A destroyed apartment building in the besieged city of Mariupol, taken on Friday April 22)\n\nMore than 100,000 people - down from a prewar population of about 430,000 - are believed trapped in Mariupol with little food, water or heat, and over 20,000 civilians have been killed in the nearly two-month siege. (Pictured: A pile of clothes are seen hanging on the door of a torched and burnt out car in Mariupol on Friday)\n\nTeams work by a destroyed building in Ukraine's besieged port city of Mariupol where the Russian Army has taken control\n\nNew satellite photos have revealed a second mass grave near Mariupol - as Russian forces continue to pummel the last 2,000 Ukrainian defenders trapped in a steelworks in the city.\n\nThe latest photos from Maxar Technologies showed the site at a cemetery in the town of Vynohradne. It has several newly dug parallel trenches measuring about 131 feet long, Maxar said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, Maxar released photos of what appeared to be rows upon rows of more than 200 freshly dug mass graves next to a cemetery in the town of Manhush, outside Mariupol. That prompted Ukrainian accusations that the Russians are trying to conceal the slaughter of civilians in the city.\n\n'This confirms again that the occupiers arrange the collection, burial and cremation of dead residents in every district of the city,' Andryushchenko said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nThe Ukrainians estimated that the graves seen in the photos released Thursday could hold 9,000 bodies. The Kremlin did not respond to the satellite pictures.\n\nRussia still has not established air or sea control due to Ukrainian resistance, and despite President Vladimir Putin's declaration of victory in Mariupol, 'heavy fighting continues to take place, frustrating Russian attempts to capture the city, thus further slowing their desired progress in the Donbas,' the Ministry of Defense said.\n\nRussia has pulled a dozen crack military units from Mariupol to bolster the offensive elsewhere in the Donbas, while other troops continue to keep the remaining Ukrainian troops in the city pinned in the Azovstal steelworks, the last remaining stronghold, Ukrainian officials said.\n\n'Every day they drop several bombs on Azovstal,' said Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor. 'Fighting, shelling, bombing do not stop.'\n\nMariupol has been reduced largely to smoking rubble by weeks of bombardment, and Russian state TV showed the flag of the pro-Moscow Donetsk separatists raised on what it said was the city's highest point, its TV tower. It also showed what it said was the main building at Azovstal steel plant in flames.\n\nA view of the destruction in Ukraine's besieged port city of Mariupol where the Russian Army has taken control.
