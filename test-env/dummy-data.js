    "body": "Updated\n10:12 a.m. ET\nWARSAW  For the past seven weeks, Dr. Simona Neliubsiene has struggled to focus on her patients charts, distracted by images of bombed cities flashing in her head.\nAt night, she lies awake in bed, her heart thumping, frantically doom-scrolling through the latest news about Russias war in Ukraine\nI never had anxiety attacks before, said Dr. Neliubsiene, a family physician in Kaunas, Lithuania. But after the first week of the war, I started thinking that maybe I should take some of the pills that I am prescribing to my patients.\nMany Eastern Europeans feel intimately connected to the conflict in their region. Although the violencehas not yet spilled outside Ukraine, some people in neighboring countries said they were making detailed war contingency plans  just in case. They complained that they were unable to escape the relentless news coverage.\nSome even said they were afraid to fall asleep.\nTheir anxiety may be deeply rooted, and even prompted by generational trauma.\nImage\nThe site of a mass grave in Bucha, Ukraine. For many in Eastern Europe, the news and images emerging from the war have been difficult to process.\nCredit...\nDaniel Berehulak for The New York Times\nBecause of the proximity of the war in Ukraine, some Eastern Europeans are afraid of getting pulled into the fight. Images of the bloodshed only hundreds of miles away are dredging up painful memories of atrocities committed by Russian soldiers during World War II and the Soviet occupation in this part of the world years ago.\nAnd there are about four million Ukrainian refugeesnow in the region whose suffering is a constant reminder of how real  and how close  this war is.\nThe images of atrocities attributed to Russian soldiers in the Ukrainian town of Bucha pouring out of news media outlets, have only compounded these feelings.\nWhen I saw those images, I was not able to move, Dr. Neliubsiene said. My family did not get supper that evening.\nAccording to interviews with over a dozen mental health professionals and patients from Eastern Europe, there has been a surge in profound anxiety, as well as in requests for sleeping pills and calls to crisis hotlines.\nThis is a raw existential crisis, said Sara Koszeg, a psychologist from Budapest, who started a project documenting peoples nightmaresabout the war. And it has a biological effect: You are alert all the time, and this affects your sleep.\nKatarzyna Skorzynska, 34, a fashion designer from Warsaw, said she kept waking up at 4 a.m., hours before she normally starts her day.\nImage\nKatarzyna Skorzynska, a fashion designer from Warsaw, said she was having trouble sleeping because of the war in Ukraine. My thoughts are racing, she said.\nCredit...\nMaciek Nabrdalik for The New York Times\nI have been feeling overwhelmed and helpless, she said. Once I wake up, it is very difficult to fall back asleep. My thoughts are racing.\nAnd it does not help that she starts her day by looking at the news. Wake up, check on Zelensky, coffee: This has been my morning routine, she said, referring to President Volodymyr Zelenskyof Ukraine, whose face has dominated Polish news media since the war began in February.\nStaying updated on the latest war developments has become a bit of an obsession for some, who hope that doing so will make them feel like they are more in control. But the reality is that it has had the exact opposite effect.\nVytenis Deimantas, 29, a social scientist from Vilnius, Lithuanias capital, said that he had trouble falling and staying asleep, but that even when he takes sleeping pills, he wakes up after only about five hours. Then, he rolls over, grabs his phone and scrolls through news websites. There is a feeling of powerlessness, he said. And the more you think about it, the stronger it is.",

The work of snipers has been recorded in some areas.\"\nThe statement said Russian forces were \"enraged by the losses in the Black Sea\" and had \"intensified the missile threat\" in the region.\nNatalia Humeniuk, the spokeswoman for the armed forces in southern Ukraine, said that the missile attacks since Thursday night were in retaliation for the Moskva sinking.\nExclusive: Zelensky says world should be prepared for possibility Putin could use nuclear weapons\n\"We all realize that we will not be forgiven,\" she said, accusing Russia of using \"cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.\"\nThe UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has previously said it had received credible allegations that Russian armed forces have used cluster munitions in populated areas in Ukraine. The nongovernmental organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) has also confirmed Russia's use of cluster munitions throughout the conflict.\nZelensky has on Friday praised the Ukrainian armed forces for repelling Russian attacks, saying they were \"doing it brilliantly.\"\nZelensky has also praised the help Ukraine was getting from western countries, but has asked for more weapons to be shipped to the country. \"The more and the sooner we get all the weapons we have requested, the stronger our position will be and the sooner peace will come,\" he said.\nMore weapons for Ukraine\nIn another sign that the war in Ukraine is not going the way Russia has planned, Moscow has formally protested America's ongoing shipment of weapons to Ukraine. It sent a\ndiplomatic note\nto the State Department warning of \"unpredictable consequences\" should the support continue, according to two US officials and another source familiar with the document.\nSome Biden administration officials believe that the diplomatic note shows the Russians are hurting, one official said. The official explained that they believe the Russians would not have sent that message if they felt they were in a strong place on the battlefield.\nThe note, known as a demarche, was sent earlier this week as the US administration was preparing to announce that it would be sending a new military aid package worth $800 million to the Ukrainians. The EU has also approved an additional 500 million euros for military equipment for Ukraine.\nDonbas, Ukraine's ravaged heartland, has suffered eight years of warfare. Here's why Putin wants it\nFor the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US is providing Kyiv with high-power capabilities that some Biden administration officials viewed as too much of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago.\nThese include Mi-17 helicopters, 18 155 mm Howitzers and 300 more Switchblade drones. These types of weapons are designed for the type of fighting that's likely to take place in the Donbas region open terrain rather than urban and wooded areas.\nThe Ukrainian military and regional officials have said Russian attacks have intensified in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east of the country as they prepare for a major ground offensive there.\nSerhii Haidai, head of the Luhansk region military administration, has warned civilians who remain in Luhansk to leave the area. \"It is extremely dangerous to stay in the cities now. The shelling intensified,\" he said.\nThe Ukrainian armed forces General Staff said that \"the main focus of the Russian enemy is on the regrouping and strengthening of troops\" around Slobozhansky, an area that is a short distance south of Kharkiv.\nIn the same area, according to the General Staff, Russian forces have concentrated up to 22 battalion tactical groups around Izium.

    "description": "Video shows Patrick Lyoya disobeyed an officer during an April 4 traffic stop, tried to run, then wrestled with the officer over his Taser before the officer fatally shot him in Grand Rapids, Michigan",
    "body": "Corey Williams and Aaron Morrison | AP\nToday at\n10:46 a.m. EDT\nA TV display shows video evidence of a Grand Rapids police officer struggling with and shooting Patrick Lyoya at Grand Rapids City Hall on Wednesday, April 13, 2022. Lyoya, 26, was shot and killed about 8:10 a.m., on April 4, after what police said was a traffic stop. (Grand Rapids Police Department) (Uncredited/Grand Rapids Police Department)\nPlaceholder while article actions load\nThe video seems clear: Patrick Lyoya disobeyed an officer during a traffic stop, tried to run, then wrestled with the officer over his Taser before the officer fatally shot him in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nGeorge Floyd's\n2020 slaying by Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, the 2014 strangulation death of Eric Garner by a New York City officer and the shooting death of Michael Brown that same year by an officer in Ferguson, Missouri, are among high-profile encounters that proved deadly for Black men.\nA store employee called police, saying Floyd allegedly tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. Police stopped Garner on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes. An officer confronted Brown and a companion as they walked to Browns home from a convenience store. Brown was shot after scuffling with the officer. All three men were unarmed.\nAdvertisement\nBecause of the way police are commonly portrayed, there can be anxiety for young men of color when they are pulled over, said Jason Johnson, president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund. Am I going to get a ticket? Am I going to get arrested? They may believe they are going to be a victim of abuse. Many times they enter into these interactions thinking they are going to be a victim of brutality.\nIn 2015, a white police officer in Columbia, South Carolina, pulled over Walter Scott, a 50-year-old Black man, for a broken brake light. A bystanders video captured the two tumbling to the ground after the officer hit Scott with a Taser.\nThe officer then shot Scott as he tried to run.\nIn Lyoyas case, some  including his family and their high-profile attorney, Ben Crump   have said the 26-year-old Congolese refugee was slain for having a license plate that did not belong to the vehicle. While thats why the officer  stopped Lyoya, Johnson said, thats not why Lyoya was killed.\nAdvertisement\nIts one of the disconnects or misunderstandings between the police and the public, Johnson said. If you look a little bit deeper, thats not what happened. (Lyoya) had a number of opportunities to comply with the officers directions. This use of deadly force had nothing to do with a traffic violation and everything to do with (Lyoya) actively resisting arrest.\nLyoyas actions led down the path that ultimately ended in deadly force, Johnson added.\nGrand Rapids police on Wednesday released video of the April 4 stop,  including from the officers vehicle and body camera, from a bystanders cellphone and from a doorbell camera.  The videos show the brief foot chase  and a struggle as the white officer repeatedly tells Lyoya to stop. At one point, Lyoya has his hand on the officers stun gun, and the officer yells at him to let go.\nAdvertisement\nThe struggle ended when the officer shot Lyoya in the head as Lyoya was facedown, with the officer straddling him.\nScott Roberts, senior director of criminal justice and democracy campaigns at Color of Change, a national racial justice organization, said officers are often fearful given the dangers involved with making stops. But that doesnt negate that Black motorists suffer for showing or expressing their justified fears in traffic stops, he said.\nLooking at police culture, there is just this pushback on the notion that policing is rooted in white supremacy and has been a tool of white supremacy, Roberts said. And so there is a kind of denial of why Black people would have that fear. Youve already criminalized the person when youre making a pre-textual stop. Your assumption is going to be that this is only a confirmation of their guilt, that fear.\nAdvertisement\nRoberts added that these dynamics have increasingly led cities, prosecutors and police to enact policies that deemphasize or end stops for minor infractions.\nSkin color and experiences could skew how all parties interpret interactions and confrontations between Black Americans and white officers, said Paul Bergman, professor emeritus of law at UCLA.\nCultural narratives may lead white officers as well as Black officers to anticipate trouble when the person they are stopping is Black, he said.\nIn Lyoyas case, was he more likely to be pulled over because he was Black? Bergman asked. If he wasnt Black, would this be more of a minor infraction and would the police officer think he had better things to do?\nThe situation escalated when Lyoya didnt produce a drivers license and tried to run. That likely raised the officers suspicions, Bergman said.\nAdvertisement\nBut Lyoya also might have believed his best option was to flee, he said.\nMaybe hes thinking to just escape a situation thats threatening, Bergman added. Lawfully, youre expected to comply with lawful demands. The place to argue if you think its unlawful is later. Were expected to fight those arguments out in courts and not in the street.\nAmara Enyia, policy and research manager for the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 150 Black-led organizations, said the fear that Black motorists feel is rooted in generations of adversarial relations with police.\nWhen stops for license plates, broken taillights or improper lane changes turn into violent arrests or fatal encounters, departments turn to old solutions, such as anti-bias training, that have failed to make a difference, Enyia said.\nAdvertisement\nYou just have to wonder how many billions and billions of dollars does it take to train that kind of bias out of someone, she said. Instead of making structural changes to the entire system, you have to rely on the benevolence, goodwill or altruism of a police officer to stay alive in what is otherwise a routine traffic stop.\n___\nWilliams and Morrison are members of APs Race and Ethnicity Team.

    "body": "How this Republican is trying to out-Trump the competition in a key Senate race\n04:19\nA person familiar with his thinking said Trump has always felt the most comfortable around Vance but had been taken aback at times by polls that were presented to him and showed the bestselling author in third or fourth place behind his MAGA-aligned competitors.\n\"His endorsement in primaries tends to matter, and he doesn't want to get this wrong,\" said one Trump adviser, who requested anonymity to speak about private deliberations.\nReports of Trump's promised endorsement had sent Republicans across Ohio scrambling to stop it.\nAfter NBC News first reportedThursday that Trump was on the brink of backing Vance before the primary, some of Vance's opponents began urging the former President, through private and public channels, to reconsider.\nA small group of county GOP chairs drafted and began circulating a letter attempting to remind Trump of Vance's past criticisms of him. The letter came to the attention of the Timken's and Mandel's campaigns, both of which helped promote it to encourage other Republican leaders in the state to sign on, according to people close to those campaigns.\nThe draft letter had been signed by several county GOP chairs and other state party leaders, all of whom support different candidates in the Senate race.\n\"This was sort of a grassroots, organic process,\" said Lisa Stickan, who chairs the Cuyahoga County GOP.\nStickan, who is supporting Gibbons in the Senate primary, told CNN prior to Trump's endorsement that she doubts these local party leaders would have come together if Trump were planning to back one of the other candidates.\n\"I don't think there would have been the same reaction,\" she said.\nTrump's endorsement power will be put to the test as May primaries approach\nIn addition, a polling memo from Remington Research Group, which works for Mandel's campaign, began circulating among Republicans in Ohio and among the press Thursday night. The memo, obtained by CNN, purported to demonstrate that Vance would not be able to significantly boost his position in the crowded GOP primary field (which also includes state Sen. Matt Dolan who has not actively sought Trump's support).\n\"JD Vance will still lose even with President Trump's endorsement,\" the memo read.\nBut those hoping to reverse Trump's intention to back Vance didn't have any luck. One person close to the former President said Trump reviewed a new poll that showed Vance pulling ahead of Timken and Gibbons and into second place behind Mandel, giving him confidence that his endorsement could carry Vance to victory in the primary.\nAnother source close to Trump said the former President has come to view Vance -- whose tirades against corporate and political elites have become a programming staple on Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" -- as his \"ideological twin\" and someone who \"fell in line\" following Trump's ascension to power.\n\"Here's the mistake that everybody makes when they assume that past criticism of [Trump] disqualifies someone in his mind: He considered Mitt Romney for secretary of state. It's the weakest argument that people can make. Trump is like, 'Can you be more original?'\" said one of the people close to the former President.\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction and details.\nCNN's Brian Rokus contributed to this report.\nSearch",

And at least a few from both groups may gaze appreciatively at the statue and wonder if this all could have been done a good while ago, when Seaver was still alive and in relatively good health.\nThat question didnt really seem to matter in Fridays late-morning ceremony, which drew a sizable outpouring of buoyant Mets fans, happy that the sun was shining, happy that they were about to get their first look at the statue, happy, too, that the Mets were off to a 5-2 start this season.\nImage\nNancy Seaver was a highlight of the ceremony, as was Jacob deGrom, who showed up in uniform.\nCredit...\nCalla Kessler for The New York Times\nImage\nAfter multiple delays in its unveiling, the Mets still went through the process of hiding the statue behind a curtain.\nCredit...\nCalla Kessler for The New York Times\nThey cheered when the injured Jacob deGrom perhaps the best Mets pitcher since Seaver, showed up in baseball pants and a Mets sweatshirt and sat down in the first row to take it all in. They jeered when the Queens borough president, Donovan Richards, went on too long in his remarks, cheered when Mike Piazza spoke and more or less applauded when Steven Cohen, who took over as the Mets owner a year and half ago, got up to speak.\nThe 2022 M.L.B. Season\nA season that was in doubt is suddenly in full gear.\nSix Outs From Perfection: Could you pull a pitcher who was six outs from a perfect game? Would you? Dave Roberts has done it twice\nDivision Rivals: The Yankees and the Toronto Blue Jays\nwill be duking it out all season\nin the ultracompetitive A.L. East.\nA First at First Base: Alyssa Nakken is no stranger to firsts, and she added another to her rsum by filling in as a first base coach. She was\nthe first woman with an on-field role\nin Major League Baseball history.\nStrong Start: Defeats are inevitable during a six-month season. But early signs point to the Mets winning a lot\nAnd when Nancy Seaver, at times using a wheelchair, went endearingly off-script while talking about her late husband and ended with a Bless you all, the crowd chanted her name. It was that kind of ceremony.\nThe Seaver statue will undoubtedly become a pregame meeting place for fans, a role, until now, that had more or less fallen to the old Home Run Apple. This should make for a nice upgrade.\nIndeed, in recent decades, a lot of teams have erected statues outside their stadiums as a way to honor their famous players (and even some beloved broadcasters). But the Mets previous owners, the Wilpons, chose not to do so, even though saluting Seaver in that fashion seemed like an easy enough thing to do.\nThings changed in June 2019, when the Wilpons announced that a statue of Seaver was being commissioned and that the address for Citi Field was being changed to 41 Seaver Way. Just months before, Seavers family had disclosed that he was suffering from dementia and was retiring from public life. He died at the end of August 2020, his death attributed to both the coronavirus and dementia, and it was hard to ignore that the statue had not yet been completed.\nImage\nAn enthusiastic crowd showed up to the afternoon game early to see the statues unveiling.\nCredit...\nCalla Kessler for The New York Times\nImage\nNancy and Anne Seaver, wife and daughter of Tom Seaver, at the unveiling.\nCredit...\nCalla Kessler for The New York Times\nIt was scheduled to be unveiled last summer, but the pandemic delayed matters. And it was delayed again when the start of the 2022 season was pushed back by the recent labor standoff.\nThat the ceremony ended up taking place on April 15  Jackie Robinson Day when baseball annually honors Robinsons first game in the major leagues  was a nice touch, coincidental as it might have been. As it is, the Seaver statue is close by Citi Fields rotunda, which is graced by a large tribute to Robinson. So the hero of Queens, No. 41, will be within shouting distance of the hero of Brooklyn, who famously wore No. 42.\nThe Mets will also soon retire the No. 17worn by Keith Hernandez in a ceremony set for this summer. He was the leader of the Mets 1986 championship team and, for some, the best player the Mets have had since Seaver. As with the Seaver statue, it arguably took too long to honor Hernandez. As with the Seaver statue, the decision to take No. 17 out of circulation was actually made by the Wilpons, as was the decision to retire the No. 36 worn by Jerry Koosman Seavers left-handed sidekick, last August.\nImage\nMike Piazza, like Seaver a Hall of Famer, spoke at the ceremony.\nCredit...\nCalla Kessler for The New York Times\nIn each of those instances, better late than not at all. If the Wilpons could do it all over again, maybe they would have acted more quickly. But that, of course, is not the way things work. Instead, you make amends when you can and keep showing up.\nWhich is what Fred Wilpon, now 85, did on Friday. The teams former principal owner sat in the second row during the statue dedication and lingered afterward. Asked if he wished the statue could have been unveiled years ago, he considered the question and replied: Im just glad its done now. It was a beautiful ceremony.\nAdvertisement",

    "body": "April 16, 2022,\n12:04 p.m. ET\nRussia pounded military targets throughout Ukraine on Saturday, in apparent retaliation for the sinking of an important naval ship and in preparation for an offensive in the Donbas region of the countrys east.\nRussias Defense Ministry said Saturday the strikes had destroyed workshops in a tank factory in Kyiv and a military hardware repair facility in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine. Also targeted was the Ukrainian military factory on the outskirts of Kyiv, called Vizar, that produced the Neptune anti-ship missile that\nsank the flagship vessel\nof Russias Black Sea fleet, the Moskva, in a major embarrassment for the Kremlin.\nThe coming battle in the eastwill be fought largely on open terrain offering far fewer havens for Ukrainian fighters to hide while launching attacks on Russian armored vehicles, as they did so successfully in repelling the Russian forces from around Kyiv. The Russian missile attacks on Friday into Saturday seemed calibrated to weaken Ukraines ability to withstand armored assaults in that setting.\nImage\nEmergency workers tended to the wounded after the missile strike in Kharkiv.\nCredit...\nTyler Hicks/The New York Times\nThe strikes served as a reminder that wherever the fighting is concentrated on the ground, Russia still can and will strike anywhere in Ukraine, and they underscored the importance of Ukraines industrial capacity, including its ability to make and repair weapons.\nWhy Russia waited until two months into the war to target these facilities is unclear. While the strikes could have been a response to the sinking of the Moskva, Russias Defense Ministry has not acknowledged that Ukrainian missiles hit the ship, which it says was mortally wounded by a fire and ammunition explosion.\nSome analysts have pointed to the recent appointment of a top Russian battlefield commander in Ukraine,Gen. Aleksandr V. Dvornikov, as a factor in Moscows strategy. He is expected to address the lack of coordination and planning that has hampered Russian forces so far, reorganizing and redirecting them for the fighting in Donbas.\nThe rocket and missile attacks on Saturday also rained down on an airport in central Ukraine, the Black Sea port of Odesa, the northeastern city of Kharkiv and the western city of Lviv. Explosions from at least one strike shook Kyiv, the capital, and Ukraines air defense force said it had shot down a volley of four cruise missiles in flight elsewhere in the country.\nMoscow retaliated diplomatically against the West on Saturday, barring Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other senior British officials from entering the country over their support for Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. Mr. Johnson has been a leading voice in Europe against Moscow, and even traveled to Kyiv a week agoto meet with Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\nBritain has supplied Ukraine with new anti-ship missile systems, armored vehicles and other military equipment. Ukrainian fighters have used anti-tank weapons supplied by Britain to devastating effect against Russias armored vehicles.\nImage\nA military factory called Vizar,  which produced the Neptune missiles used to attack the flagship of Russias Black Sea fleet, was struck by Russian missiles.\nCredit...\nFadel Senna/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images\nIn Germany, the economy minister called on people to cut back their energy consumption, including by drawing curtains and lowering the temperature in their homes, as part of what he described as a national effort to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Germany has joined other Western nations in imposing embargoes on Russian coal and possibly oil, but it is reluctant to do the same with Russian gas, which accounts for\nmore than half its gas imports.\nWe can only become more independent of Russian imports if we see it as a large joint project in which we all participate, the minister, Robert Habeck, told the Funke media group on Friday. He added, in reference to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia: Its easy on the wallet and annoys Putin.\nUkrainian forces repelled the Russian attempt to seize Kyiv, and Moscow has withdrawn tens of thousands of troops from that region. Residents have been streaming back into the city since then, but the window-rattling blasts Saturday became a stark reminder that the war is far from over, even far from the front.\nRussias cruise missiles, the principal weapon in Saturdays attacks, can strike over long distances at sites throughout the country. Through the day Saturday, air raid sirens wailed in Kyiv, and overnight the distant, dull thuds of air defense missiles exploding could be heard in the sky over the city.\nOur air defenses are working, our military is defending us, but all the same there were explosions, in a southeastern district of the capital, Kyivs mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said in a statement on Telegram. The strike killed one person and wounded several others, he said.\nIn the statement, Mr. Klitschko said Kyiv remains a target for Russia despite the defeat of the ground assault force, which retreated hastily, leaving in its wake burned tanks, its own war dead and hundreds of civilian bodies lying on streets. Police said Friday they have so far found 900 bodies of civilians in the Kyiv region, the administrative district surrounding the capital.\nImage\nFreshly dug graves in Irpin, Ukraine, outside Kyiv, the site of intense fighting in the first month of the war.\nCredit...\nDavid Guttenfelder for The New York Times\nPresident Zelensky said in a late night address on Saturday that Russian forces had been expelled from nearly 1,000 villages, towns and cities of varying sizes across Ukraine. Most of the liberated communities lie in the northern parts of the country and had suffered extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure during the monthlong Russian occupation.",

    "body": "Today at\n11:04 a.m. EDT\nChase Elliott waits in his pit before a practice session for the NASCAR Cup Series auto race Friday, April 15, 2022, at Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol, Tenn. (David Crigger/Bristol Herald Courier via AP) (David Criggerr/Bristol Herald Courier)\nPlaceholder while article actions load\nBRISTOL, Tenn.  Kevin Harvick was on his annual family beach vacation when he was forced to cut it short early by three days to return to work for the first time in his career on Easter Sunday.\nNASCAR since its 1949 inaugural season deliberately used Easter as an off weekend  often the first natural break in a 38-race season  and industry personnel slotted that week for a rare vacation. Weather-related rescheduling actually led to 10 races on Easter Sunday over the years, most recently in 1989 when a snowstorm forced a scheduling change, but NASCAR never deliberately chose the date.\nArrowRight\nUntil this year.\nNASCAR executive Ben Kennedy, great-grandson of NASCARs founder, worked with Fox to schedule the second Cup Series race on dirt-covered Bristol Motor Speedway for Sunday night under the lights in a bid to attract a larger television audience.\nAdvertisement\nWhen you think about all the other sports leagues with NFL on Thanksgiving, NBA on Christmas, this is our opportunity to run on Easter Sunday and drive a lot of momentum for our fans that are watching at home, Kennedy said when the race was announced. We put a lot of consideration into family time. I think to that end, having it later in the day, and on primetime on Sunday, we want to make sure that for fans, families, team members, drivers, that they have the opportunity to celebrate earlier on in the day.\nThen for fans that may be tuning in at night or coming out to the track that evening, the ability to come out there and continue to be together and watch NASCAR racing we felt like was important.\nBut as Harvick returned from the beach earlier than planned, he warned the decision to race Sunday night better have a monstrous payoff. In scheduling Bristol for Easter, NASCAR stripped the premier Cup Series of all but one off weekend spanning from February until November.\nAdvertisement\nThe only way its successful is if the TV ratings are through the roof. Thats the only way that having it on Easter night is successful, Harvick said. Thats the only reason it is where it is is for a TV rating, so if it doesnt have a TV rating, you should never do it again.\nIts an experiment, which Im fine with experiments if its beneficial. If its beneficial for this sport and beneficial for TV ratings and beneficial for a number of things, then Im all in. But that will be the real tell of success if that rating is way up compared to what it was.\nBut not everyone is onboard as deliberately racing on Easter is unheard of in a sport that begins each event with an invocation and an optional Sunday pre-race church service. Bristol Motor Speedway has scheduled a live Easter Celebration Worship Service at the track to be held three hours before the green flag.\nAdvertisement\nNot a big fan of racing on Easter. I feel like thats a very special day, a day thats equally as big as Christmas, if not bigger, so Im not crazy about it, said defending race winner Joey Logano. I also understand where it makes a lot of sense for a sport to do it. But its different than other sports. When other sports compete on holidays, its a couple teams here and a couple teams there. This is 40 teams.\nMaybe, its going to be fantastic. Ill have my family with me so thats good, but its going to be a lot different Easter than what were used to. Having a church service for industry, I think that that part is good.\nODDS AND ENDS\nKyle Larson is the FanDuel favorite at 9-2. ... The conversion of Bristol to a dirt track last year was the first Cup race on dirt in 50 years. But NASCAR had early experience on the surface prior to the Modern Era with 501 races on dirt from 1949 to 1970. Jim Roper in a Lincoln won the first Cup Series race on dirt in 1948 on 0.75-mile Charlotte (Old) Speedway. ... NASCAR has had 77 different drivers win on dirt, led by Hall of Famer Lee Petty with 46 victories. .... Chris Tomlin, a Grammy Award-winning worship leader, and pastor Max Lucado will headline a live pre-race Easter celebration service. Rascal Flatts lead singer Gary LeVox will perform.\n___\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\nComment",

    "description": "As the founder of the independent label Specialty Records, he helped set the table for the rock n roll era by signing performers like Little Richard.",
    "body": "Good Golly, Miss Molly.\nArt Rupe had a tremendous impact on rock n roll, said John Broven, the author of Record Makers and Breakers (2009), a history of early rock n rolls independent record producers. Lawdy Miss Clawdy was really the first record to cross over and reach a teenage white audience, and then came Little Richard with Tutti-Frutti and Long Tall Sally. These were monumental records that almost created rock n roll in themselves.\nArt Rupe was born Arthur Newton Goldberg on Sept. 5, 1917, in Greensburg, Pa., a suburb of Pittsburgh, and grew up in nearby McKeesport, where his father, David, was a salesman at a secondhand furniture store and his mother, Anna, was a music lover. After attending Virginia Polytechnic Institute and Miami University in Ohio, he moved to Los Angeles in 1939.\nHe enrolled in business courses at U.C.L.A. with the idea of entering the film business; he also changed his last name to Rupe after being told by a relative that it had been the familys original surname in Europe. After World War II broke out, he worked at a local shipyard on an engineering crew that tested Liberty ships.\nThe movie business, he found, was tough to enter, and he shifted his attention to the recording industry. Responding to a newspaper ad, he invested $2,500 in a new label, Atlas Records, which lost most of his money and failed to produce hits by its two main artists, Nat King Cole and Frankie Laine.\nImage\nRoy Milton and His Solid Senders in a publicity photo. Mr. Milton, standing, a jump-blues singer, recorded numerous Top 10 R&B hits for Specialty.\nCredit...\nCourtesy of Colin Escott\nAfter selling his interest in Atlas for $600, Mr. Rupe created his own company, Juke Box Records, in 1944. I called it Juke Box because the jukebox was the medium then for plugging records, he told Arnold Shaw. If you got a record into the boxes, it was tantamount to getting it on the top stations today.\nMr. Rupe was methodical. He bought $200 worth of race records and, stopwatch in hand, began analyzing musical structure, tempo and even titles to identify the common characteristics of the best-selling releases. Since the word boogie appeared in a disproportionate number of hit songs, Juke Boxs first record, an instrumental by the Sepia Tones, was given the title Boogie No. 1.It sold a more than respectable 70,000 copies, and Mr. Rupe was on his way.\nThe jump-blues singer Roy Milton and his band, the Solid Senders, gave Juke Box its first big hit: R.M. Blues,released in 1945, which was said to have sold a million copies. Mr. Milton went on to record nearly 20 Top 10 R&B hits after following Mr. Rupe to Specialty, which he founded the next year after breaking with his Juke Box partners.\nIn 1950 the pianist and bandleader Joe Liggins gave Specialty its first No. 1 hit, Pink Champagne,which became the top-selling R&B record of the year. Percy Mayfield, a singer and songwriter with a relaxed, swinging style who would later contribute Hit the Road, Jack and other songs to Ray Charless repertoire, topped the charts a year later with Please Send Me Someone to Love. Guitar Slim gave the label yet another No. 1 hit in 1954 with The Things That I Used to Do,one of the earliest records to put the electric guitar front and center.\nSpecialty was a little like the Blue Note label in jazz, said the singer and music historian Billy Vera, who produced The Specialty Story, a boxed set of the labels best sides released in 1994, and wrote Rip It Up: The Specialty Records Story, published in 2019. Art was dollar conscious, but he did not let that stop him from going into the better studios and taking the time to rehearse. He took great pride and care to make quality records with quality musicians.\nSpecialty exerted a powerful influence on the British invasion bands of the 1960s, and even its second-tier acts had a ripple effect. Larry Williams, a New Orleans singer groomed by Specialty to fill the void when Little Richard left the music business in 1957, had solid hits with Short Fat Fannieand Bony Moronie,but even his lesser singles made an impression overseas. His single She Said Yeahwas covered by the Rolling Stones and the Animals. The Beatles recorded three of his songs: Bad Boy,\nDizzy Miss Lizzy\nand Slow Down.Don and Dewey, another Specialty act, never had a hit, but their sound greatly influenced the Righteous Brothers and Sam and Dave.\nMr. Rupe, a longtime fan of gospel music, quickly made Specialtys gospel division an industry leader, signing the Pilgrim Travelers, the Swan Silvertones, Alex Bradford, Brother Joe May and Sister Wynona Carr. Two of the labels most famous gospel groups generated crossover stars for other labels: Sam Cooke became a pop star after leaving the Soul Stirrers, as did Lou Rawls, who recorded with the Chosen Gospel Singers.\nMr. Cooke was the one that got away. In 1956, he recorded a pop tune, \nLovable\n, produced by Specialtys Bumps Blackwell with a lush background chorus and released with the singers name thinly disguised as Dale Cook. Mr. Rupe disliked the smooth pop treatment and let Mr. Blackwell and Mr. Cooke leave the label with the other recordings from that session in hand. One song, \nYou Send Me\n, became a chart-topping hit and ignited Mr. Cookes remarkable career.\nIn all candor, I did not think You Send Me was that great, Mr. Rupe told an interviewerfor the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2011. I never dreamed it would be a multimillion seller.\nImage\nMr. Rupe in 2019. He sold Specialtys catalog in 1990 and created the Arthur N. Rupe Foundation in 1991.\nCredit...\nRauh Jewish Archives, Heinz History Center\nBy 1960, Mr. Rupe was growing disenchanted with the record business, particularly with the widespread system of payola, which required record companies to pay off disc jockeys and distributors to get their records heard.\nIncreasingly, he let assistants like Harold Battiste in New Orleans, and Sonny Bono, in Los Angeles, produce and market the labels records. In 1990, he sold Specialtys catalog to Fantasy Records\nWhile still at Specialty, Mr. Rupe invested successfully in oil and real estate and started his own oil company. In 1991 he created\nthe Arthur N. Rupe Foundation\n, whose stated goals include achieving positive social change by shining the light of truth on critical and controversial issues and providing support for caregivers of people with dementia.\nIn addition to his daughter  from the second of his three marriages, to Lee Apostoleris, which ended in divorce  Mr. Rupe is survived by a granddaughter; a step-grandson; and two step-great-granddaughters. His third wife, Dorothy Rupe, and three siblings died before him.\nIn 2011, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame gave Mr. Rupe the Ahmet Ertegun Award for Lifetime Achievement, an honor given to record-company executives.\nWhen I got into the business, few white people fooled around with this kind of music, Mr. Rupe told Arnold Shaw. I had no idea that it would ever appeal to so m",

    "body": "ArrowRight\nA key component of his argument: If he succeeds in his $43 billion takeover, he wants to make public the computer code that determines what people see on Twitter to ensure the platform is fair. The algorithm determines the priority in which tweets get served up to users, either expanding or limiting how many millions of people see them. Specifically, he said he wants to make the algorithm that recommends whether a tweet gets promoted or demoted open source, or available for the public to view and improve upon. That, he said, will help prevent behind the scenes manipulation.\nAdvertisement\nIf someones tweets are emphasized or de-emphasized, that action should remain apparent, he said in a live broadcast from a TED conference Thursday.\nFive reasons it will be difficult for Elon Musk to buy Twitter\nBut Musks proposal likely represents a gross oversimplification of how it would work to make that data public, according to researchers who study recommendation algorithms. As social media companies have grown, the software that drives their recommendation engines have grown so sprawling and complex that analyzing it would require access to a fire hose of data so immense\nthat most people wouldnt even have access to a powerful enough computer to analyze it. The algorithms at Twitter, Facebook and other social networks process billions of pieces of content and use countless datapoints to determining a ranking, from the popularity of a post to who posted it.\nThe algorithm is not one thing, said Nick Seaver, an anthropology professor at Tufts who researches the algorithms that drive recommendation engines. The systems are so complex, he says, that tech companies themselves often find it difficult to know why their software showed a user one post over another.\nAdvertisement\nThe people inside Twitter want to understand how their algorithm works, too, he said.\nTwitter, Facebook and Musk didnt respond to requests for comment.\nThe opaqueness of algorithms that fuel what people see on social media sites has long been a fascination for conservatives in particular, who have alleged without evidence that the platforms are biased against them. Musks attempts to gain sway over Twitter this week have resulted in rejoicing on the right, as some speculate he may try to reduce the policing of misinformation and restore former president Donald Trump to the platform.\nTwitter adopts poison pill intended to thwart Elon Musks takeover bid\nThere have been efforts to make algorithms more transparent through regulation. Last year, several bills were introduced or reintroduced in Congress that focused explicitly on the software programs that decide what people see on social media platforms. Efforts are also advancing to regulate artificial intelligence and algorithms globally.\nAdvertisement\nWhen social networks like Facebook and Twitter were brand new, there wasnt enough content to warrant need for a complex\nalgorithm, which is essentially a set of rules similar to a mathematical equation that help parse through content and determine what is most relevant to an individual user.\nBut as hundreds of millions of users began joining and posting billions of pieces of content, the companies began writing software that could learn what users were most likely to click on and then sort their feeds accordingly.\nHow Facebook shapes your feed\nNow, companies like Facebook, video app TikTok and Twitter all use some form of algorithm to figure out what to show users. And it means that not every user on a social network sees the same thing. People obsessed with the outdoors might see posts about the best camping spots for the summer, while a basketball fan might be bombarded with posts about the NBA playoffs.\nAdvertisement\nFacebook and Twitter initially had chronological feeds, and both have faced pushes recently to bring them back as a defaults, especially amid criticism that their ranking systems help promote the spread of misinformation.\nThe complex math that most companies use is often called machine learning, which is at its core a very fancy form of pattern recognition. A computer program cant tell whether a particular tweet is funny, interesting or valuable. But if it looks at millions of tweets and a bunch of factors, like who liked it, shared it and retweeted it, it can begin to predict which tweets are likely to get attention.\nDoes Twitter over control free speech and that needs to be fixed? yes\nIs a management shake up good for Twitter and free speech? yes\nDoes @elonmusk know what he's talking about?\nNo.\nApril 14, 2022\nEven if Twitter made its secret formula public, including the math it uses to train its machine learning algorithms, an outsider looking at it wouldnt be able make meaningful conclusions from it, said Michael Ekstrand, a computer science professor at Boise State who researches recommendation engines. They would also need to see the underlying data used to train those algorithms  the billions of bits of data showing who looked at, liked or shared tweets, among many other possible factors.\nAdvertisement\nReleasing that data would raise serious privacy concerns, the experts said.\nThe algorithm is just the tip of the iceberg, said Robin Burke, a professor of information science at University of Colorado Boulder and a researcher specializing in recommendation algorithms. The rest of the ice berg is all of this data that Twitter has, he said, most of which it cant release publicly.\nWhat is going on with Elon Musk and Twitter?\nMusk should be well versed in the complicated nature of algorithms, the experts said. Tesla, a company he runs, is using machine-learning algorithms to develop autonomous driving technology. That undertaking is so massive that Tesla is building its own supercomputer and customized semiconductors to process all the data.\nThere are other ways of improving transparency that are more practical, the experts said, some of which Twitter is already doing. Some critics have called on social media companies to simplify their algorithms so that when there are issues, like perceived biases toward specific groups of people, they can be more easily addressed. Others have called for independent audits inside the companies.\nTwitter has an in-house research team called Machine Learning Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability that looks at potential biases in its algorithms. It has published research, for instance, on whether the algorithms that automatically crop profile photos contained inadvertent bias.\nAdvertisement\nOne idea that has been floated over the years is separating Twitter into multiple different algorithms. Twitter could select business partners that would have access to the data and develop algorithms tailored to certain audiences.\nNathan Baschez, co-founder of Every, a tech-focused writers collective, argued in an article Friday that Twitter should allow outsiders to create their own algorithms tailored to specific interests.
