      "body": "DAVID KLEPPER , Associated Press, Associated Press\n2022/04/19 21:01\nAs governments and social media companies have moved to suppress Russia's state media and the disinformation it spreads about the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin's diplomats are stepping up to do the dirty work.\nRussian embassies and consulates around the world are prolifically using Facebook, Twitter and other platforms to deflect blame for atrocities while seeking to undermine the international coalition supporting Ukraine.\nTech companies have responded by adding more labels to Russia's diplomatic accounts and by removing the accounts from its recommendations and search results. But the accounts are still active and are disseminating disinformation and propaganda in nearly every nation, in part because their diplomatic status gives them an added layer of protection from moderation.\nWith hundreds of social media accounts on every continent, Russias diplomatic corps acts as a global network for propaganda, in which the same claims can be recycled and tweaked for different audiences in different nations. And, so far, steps to substantially curtail that effort have fallen short.\nEach week since the beginning of the war these diplomats have posted thousands of times, gaining more than a million engagements on Twitter per week,\" said Marcel Schliebs, a disinformation researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute at Oxford University. He has tracked more than 300 social media accounts linked to Russian embassies, consulates and diplomatic groups.\nSome Russian embassies, like ones in the U.K. and Mexico, for example, are especially active, churning out pro-Russian propaganda and spreading falsehoods intended to support the invasion.\nThe Russian missile attack on a Ukrainian rail station that killed 50? Ukrainians were behind it, the Russian Embassy in the U.K. tweeted. Talk of Russian war crimes? It's a plot by Britain to make Russia look bad, the embassy claimed. Those Ukrainian soldiers fighting for their country? Theyre actually Nazis operating under U.S. orders, the embassy alleged.\nThe Russian Embassy in London tweeted out those and other conspiracy theories all on one day last week. Each post received hundreds or thousands of retweets, comments and likes, including dozens from other Twitter users pushing back on the propaganda.\nThey must know better, but thats what its like living in and working for a totalitarian regime, said Nicholas Cull, a University of Southern California professor who studies the intersection of diplomacy and propaganda. A totalitarian regime requires a media bubble. It requires censorship at home, and it requires your own messaging, both for a domestic and foreign audience. Thats what this is.\nAs representatives of their countries empowered to speak on their behalf, diplomats have always been known for pushing their nation's talking points. Russian diplomats in particular have long been known for spreading the Kremlin's disinformation. Russian diplomats used social media to spread disinformation about the invasion of Crimea in 2014 and about the poisoning of Russian dissidents.\nTheir status as representatives of a foreign government has often given them the freedom to speak\nSometimes they even try to rewrite history, as they did in 2019, when Russian diplomatic accounts used the hashtag #TruthaboutWWII to distort the Soviet Union's initial non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany. That disinformation campaign was revealed by researchers at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, which determined that Russian diplomats play a pivotal role, along with state media and social media bots, in the country's sophisticated disinformation apparatus.\nThe Kremlin tends to employ a full spectrum model of propaganda,\" the Atlantic Council researchers concluded.\nA message seeking comment from the Russian Embassy in the U.S. was not immediately returned.\nA noticeable increase in pro-Russian propaganda regarding Ukraine began in the weeks and months before the invasion even began in February.\nThe accounts were tweeting about 2,000 times per week immediately after the invasion, resulting in more than 1 million likes, retweets and comments, according to Schliebs' research.\nThat engagement fell after Twitter announced earlier this month that it would no longer promote more than 300 Russian accounts or include them in search results, a technical move known as demotion, designed to limit the accounts reach. Yet despite Twitters action, the accounts Schliebs monitored are still earning about half a million likes, retweets and comments per week.\nTwitter and Facebook have added Russian government organization\" labels to many of these accounts to ensure users know the source of the information. But Schliebs found many accounts still have no labels: Of the 300 or so accounts he's looked at, only about a third have a label.\nA Twitter spokeswoman said the company has already labeled 260,000 Tweets from Russian accounts since Feb. 28 and is continuing to add labels to accounts on a rolling basis.\nSchliebs compared the response by tech companies to Russian disinformation actions following the 2020 U.S. election, the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and the COVID-19 pandemic. Then-President Donald Trump was kicked off Twitter for inciting violence ahead of the Jan. 6 riot. But the Russian diplomats  they have spread wild conspiracy theories and blamed Ukrainians for Russian atrocities  stay on.\nBy no means am I defending him (Trump), but I fail to see the consistency in that policy, he said.\nMeta has implemented similar changes designed to label Russian diplomatic accounts and reduce their reach on its platforms, which include Facebook and Instagram.\nLast month, the company also removed a post spread by Russian diplomats that suggested its deadly air strike on a children's hospital in Mariupol was a hoax.\nSchliebs said there is a danger in platforms like Facebook and Twitter coming down too hard on the diplomatic accounts. For one, it could worsen Russia's antagonism toward U.S.-based tech companies. (Facebook, for instance, has been labeled an extremist organization.) But it could also force Russia and its supporters onto less transparent platforms like Telegram, where researchers and regulators can't see what they're saying.\nIt's a shift that Russia's diplomats are preparing for, as the Russian Embassy in the U.K. tweeted last week.\nMeet our DiploFamily on @telegram, it wrote.\nTweet",

      "body": "Copy URL\nCopied\nA big challenge for Ukraine is the exporting of existing grain stocks to provide storage capacity for the 2022 harvest and generate cash to buy seeds and fertilizers for the next planting season\nZURICH, Switzerland  Ukraine has insufficient storage capacity even for its reduced 2022 grain harvest, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said on Tuesday, April 19, with the country struggling to export existing stocks during the invasion by Russia.\nJakob Kern, the WFPs emergency coordinator in Ukraine, cited estimates that 20% of planted areas in Ukraine will not be harvested in July and that the spring planting area will be about a third smaller than usual.\nUkraine is the worlds fifth biggest exporter of wheat and in the top three for maize, barley, and sunflower seeds. Wheat production in 2021 was about 40 million tons, with another 50 million tons for the other three commodities.\nA big challenge this year is the exporting of existing grain stocks to provide storage capacity for the 2022 harvest and generate cash to buy seeds and fertilizers for the next planting season, Kern told a Geneva news briefing via video link from Ukraine.\nKern cited the countrys agriculture ministry as saying Ukraine used to export almost all its grain and oilseeds  up to 6 million tons a month  via seaports that are now blocked by the conflict.\nThe minister told us last week that the main concern at this stage is the lack of storage capacity to bring in the 2022 grain harvest. An estimated 15 million tons of grains will not have space in the silos around the country, he said.\nIf Ukraine cannot export its current stocks, farmers may not be able afford harvesting costs, let alone plant the next years crop, he added.\nThe lack of Ukrainian grain on world markets has been pushing up food prices around the world. The WFP is spending $70 million more a month to buy the same amount of food as last year, Kern said.  Rappler.com\nRecommended Stories",

The global economy will suffer significantly from the war in Ukraine, the fund further projected in its World Economic Outlook released on Tuesday.\n\"Notable downgrades to the 2022 forecast include Japan (0.9 percentage point) and India (0.8 percentage point),\" the IMF said in the World Economic Outlook released on Tuesday. The revision reflects, it added, \"in part weaker domestic demand as higher oil prices are expected to weigh on private consumption and investment and a drag from lower net exports.\"\nThe fund had earlier projected 9.5 per cent growth for the Indian economy in 2022. It slashed it by 0.5 percentage points in its January report and it has further reduced it now by 0.8 point.\nThe fund has also cut its projection for 2023 by 0.2 point to 6.9 per cent.\nThe World Bank projected 8 per cent growth for the Indian economy in 2022 in a report released last week, which also warned that the war in Ukraine will slow down South Asian countries' recovery from economic devastation caused by the Covid-19. The impact on India, it added, would be \"moderate\".\nIt said the Indian economy will grow at 8 per cent, which is slightly less than in 2021. Lingering impact of the investment programmes will keep the economy growing in the first half of 2022-23. \"The negative impact of the war in Ukraine on FY2022/23 growth is expected to be moderate, so growth will begin to taper off in the second half of 2022,\" the report said.\nThe bank attributed its India projection to constrained purchase by Indian households, incomplete recovery of the labour market in which unskilled workers were hit the hardest and inflation. On the negative side, business expectations and investment, which had improved, might sour amid elevated input prices and a faster-than-anticipated increase in borrowing costs, the bank said, adding that the travel services balance may improve as India allows international flights to resume, while exports of computer and professional services are expected to remain strong.\nThe fund said in its Tuesday report that the Ukraine war \"has triggered a costly humanitarian crisis that demands a peaceful resolution,\" the IMF report stated, adding, \"Economic damage from the conflict will contribute to a significant slowdown in global growth in 2022.\"\nGlobal growth is projected to slow from an estimated 6.1 per cent in 2021 to 3.6 per cent in 2022 and 2023, the fund said. It is 0.8 and 0.2 percentage points lower for 2022 and 2023 than in the January World Economic Outlook Update. Beyond 2023, global growth is fore-cast to decline to about 3.3 per cent over the medium term.\n\"Crucially, this forecast assumes that the conflict remains confined to Ukraine, further sanctions on Russia exempt the energy sector (although the impact of European countries' decisions to wean themselves off Russian energy and embargoes announced through March 31, 2022, are factored into the baseline), and the pandemic's health and economic impacts abate over the course of 2022,\" the report warned ominously.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor",

      "body": "Comments\nLONDON: British economic growth will slow sharply to the weakest of any major economy next year, the International Monetary Fund forecast on Tuesday, in a broader downgrade to the worlds growth prospects after Russias invasion of Ukraine.\nThe IMF cut its forecast for British gross domestic product growth this year to 3.7% from Januarys forecast of 4.7%, while for 2023 the growth rate was almost halved to 1.2% from 2.3%.\nConsumption is projected to be weaker than expected as inflation erodes real disposable income, while tighter financial conditions are expected to cool investment, the IMF said.\nLast month Britains Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) cut its 2022 growth forecast to 3.8% and reduced its 2023 forecast to 1.8%.\nAs well as being the weakest growth of any country in the Group of Seven (G7) next year, the scale of the downgrade is also bigger than for any other G7 economy.\nThe IMF forecasts - which focus on global issues - did not explain in detail why Britain, which has fairly limited direct trade links with Russia and Ukraine, would be so hard hit.\nUkraine conflict to test resilience of global financial system: IMF\nHowever, its forecasts showed that inflation in Britain would stay higher than in any big advanced economy, dropping to 5.3% in 2023 from 7.4% this year, compared with falls to 2.9% in the United States and 2.3% in the euro zone.\nBritain, like the United States, had also seen a drop in the number of older workers since the pandemic, creating labour shortages, the IMF added.\nAs part of general advice to central banks, the IMF said they should communicate clearly what they think is a neutral interest rate, as well as their willingness if needed to keep rates above that level to bring down inflation.\nThe Bank of England has said Britains neutral rate is below where it was before the 2008 financial crisis, but that it is not possible to give a specific range.\nThe IMF also said governments could offer support for households facing big price increases, but that it should be focused on poorer households.\nIMF",

      "body": "Tucker: The US is looking at a grim economic picture\nFox News host gives his take on how the U.S. should respond to the Russia-Ukraine war and provides insight on the economy on Tucker Carlson Tonight.\nKnowing what we know about our current leadership class, the one thing we can be absolutely certain of is they always go too far. They always get over their skis. They just cant help themselves. Thats who they are.\nIn February, when the Russian military invaded Ukraine,\nthere was always out there the chance that the Biden administration would find a way to turn what was a regional tragedy into something bigger, like an historical global catastrophe.\nThat was always possible. Even before Russian forces entered into Ukraine, the White House promised us that would not happen: There is no intention or interest or desire by the president to send troops to Ukraine. That was the word from Bidens publicist from the White House. She said the very same thing almost identically the next month.\nThe month after that, she said it again, Joe Biden does not have the intention of sending U.S. troops to Ukraine, Jen Psaki solemnly pledged to the nation. Why did Jen Psaki keep saying the same thing over and over? Well, because it wasnt true.\nShe had to repeat it because it was a lie. Thats a lying works. Its not believable so you have to say it again and again and again. If you want if someones lying, count the times they assert something. The more often they assert it, the less likely this to be true, but ultimately the truth does come out and this weekend it began to.\nJoe Bidens top surrogate in the Congressthat would be Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a former Biden intern  appeared on CBS News and said the opposite of what the White House has been telling us for months.\nCoons demanded that the Pentagon deploy American troops to Ukraine to fight Russian soldiers.\nJudge Ketanji Brown Jackson meets with Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, March 10, 2022, in Washington.\n(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\nCBS ANCHOR: In some public remarks this week, you said the country needs to talk about when it might be willing to send troops to Ukraine.\nSENATOR CHRIS COONS:\nIf Vladimir Putin, who has shown us how brutal he can be, is allowed to just continue to massacre civilians, to commit war crimes throughout Ukraine, without NATO, without the West coming more forcefully to his aid, I deeply worry that whats going to happen next is that we will see Ukraine turn into Syria. The American people cannot turn away from this tragedy in Ukraine. I think the history of the 21st century turns on how fiercely we defend freedom in Ukraine and that Putin will only stop when we stop him.\nWithout the West coming more forcefully to the aid of Ukraine. So, the Ukrainian military has been trained by NATO. It uses American arms.\nIn some cases, its being led by Americans.\nThe Ukrainian government is advised directly moment-to-moment by Americans. There are many Americans in Ukraine right now doing that. So, what Chris Coons is calling for is land war with Russia. Now, thats not a small thing, given that once again, Chris Coons is Joe Bidens closest ally in the Senate. Chris Coons is an unfailing and faithful spokesman for the administrations policies, whatever those policies happen to be.\nWhen Chris Coons calls for war with Russia, he does not do it accidentally and in this case, the White House has not distanced itself from what Chris Coons said.\nOh, why? Well, because war with Russia is the administrations actual policy.\nLeaders of the Democratic Party want to topple the Russian government by force and effect regime change in Russia. They have wanted this since the day that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential race.\nWe know this because theyve said so many, many times and the only reason the rest of us missed it is because we didnt take them seriously enough, but we should have.\nA hot war with Vladimir Putin, using American troops, is the logical, maybe inevitable end stage of Russiagate.\nSo, the whole thing began with Hillary Clinton complaining, then the pee tape and now its moving toward nuclear war.\nSo, what that look like, a hot war with Russia? How many Americans would die during that war? How likely is it to escalate to nuclear conflict\n? And if we succeed, if we remove Vladimir Putin from office, who will replace him as the head of Russia in charge of 6,000 nuclear weapons?\nThose are some of the first questions that jump to mind when war with Russia is discussed. But the news reader on CBS, who was interviewing Chris Coons didnt bother to ask any of those questions, nor did she ask the one thing you would need to know if you were running a functioning democracy,\nwhich is how many Americans, how many voters, actually want war with Russia?\nWhat percentage of the American population believes that Ukraines borders are worth dying for? Thats a central question in a democracy, and as it happens, we know the answer because CBS itself ran a poll on that topic just a week ago, and they ask this question: Should the United States send troops to Ukraine?\nAnswer? Fully 75% of Americans said no, the United States should not send troops to Ukraine.\nYet somehow the CBS newsreader forgot to mention any of this to Chris Coons. Why?\nWell, you know why, because in Washington, what you think is irrelevant. Our foreign policy, matters of life and death, decisions that destroy nations, are made entirely by people with no skin in the game, people who face no conceivable risk of injury, people like John Bolton,Max Boot and Toria Nuland. Your opinion doesnt factor into the equation at any point.\nVladimir President Vladimir Putin ordered Russias all-out invasion of Ukraine only eight months after TIME magazine billed President Biden as ready to take on the Russian leader.\n(Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)\nSo, if youre bothered to ask American citizens what they think (and if you care about democracy, you would) theyd likely tell you that their borders are more important to them than Ukraines borders are. That makes sense because theyre Americans, not Ukrainians. And if you ask deeper, you would find out that at the very top of their concerns is not Ukraine. They feel sympathy for the people of Ukraine, but theyre not taking up too much disk space brooding about Ukraine moment to moment because they have other things to worry about, starting with their own economy, especially the cost of food, energy and housing. Theyre worried about these things and theyre right to be worried.\nAt this point, the United States is looking at a grim economic picture.\nNBC REPORTER: Before you pull out that credit card today, beware. If you dont pay it off in full, your interest rate is probably about to jump. The Federal Reserve, the nations central bank, is expected to raise rates by a quarter point today as it tries to throw cold water on runaway inflation.\nWOMAN:  Every time you go and shop, every, like a price of something has gone up by s",

By 2023, India is estimated to grow at 6.9 per cent, the IMF said.\nThe downgrade in the 2023 growth projection for India is partly reflective of the war in Ukraine that has resulted in high energy and food prices, slowing down the growth momentum.\nAlso Read\nStock Market Updates Today: Sensex bounces back in opening trade; Nifty..\nNotable downgrades to the 2022 forecast for Asia include Japan (0.9 percentage point) and India (0.8 percentage point), \"reflecting in part weaker domestic demand -- as higher oil prices are expected to weigh on private consumption and investment -- and a drag from lower net exports,\" the report said.\nIn its report, the IMF has projected global growth at 3.6 per cent in 2022 and 2023, 0.8 and 0.2 per cent lower than in the January forecast, respectively. \"The downgrade largely reflects the war's direct impacts on Russia and Ukraine and global spillovers,\" it said.\nAlso Read\n'Biggest risk of cryptocurrency will be money laundering, terror..\nChina, which registered a growth rate of 8.1 per cent in 2021, has been projected to grow at 4.4 per cent in 2022 and by 5.1 per cent in 2023.

Its projection for 2023 has been downgraded to 2.3 per cent, according to the IMF report.\nObserving that both Russia and Ukraine are projected to experience large GDP contractions in 2022, it said the severe collapse in Ukraine is a direct result of the invasion, destruction of infrastructure, and exodus of its people.\nIn Russia, the sharp decline reflects the impact of the sanctions with a severing of trade ties, greatly impaired domestic financial intermediation, and loss of confidence. The economic effects of the war are spreading far and wide -- like seismic waves that emanate from the epicentre of an earthquake -- mainly through commodity markets, trade, and financial linkages, the report said.\nObserving that the overall risks to economic prospects have risen sharply and policy trade-offs have become even more challenging, the IMF said.\nThis crisis unfolds at a time when the global economy was on a mending path and was recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"In addition to the war, frequent and wider-ranging lockdowns in China - including in key manufacturing hubs - have also slowed activity there and could cause new bottlenecks in global supply chains.

      "description": "IN the words of UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, the war on Ukraine by Russia is fast becoming a matter of life and death for vulnerable people around the world.",
      "body": "Sir Ronald Sanders\nBy SIR RONALD SANDERS\nIN the words of UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, the war on Ukraine by Russia is fast becoming a matter of life and death for vulnerable people around the world.\nHis comment is strongly supported by a UN report, published on 13 April and entitled, Global Impact of war in Ukraine on food, energy and finance systems. Its findings make grim reading and should fully dispel all the opinions that Russian aggression against Ukraine is a white peoples war or that it does not affect regions as distant as the Caribbean.\nHeres what the report finds in summary: The war in Ukraine, is producing alarming cascading effects to a world economy already battered by COVID-19 and climate change, with particularly dramatic impacts on developing countries. Commodity prices are reaching record highs across the board. On April 8, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) stated that food prices are 34 percent higher than this time last year and have never been this high since the FAO started recording them. Crude oil prices have increased by around 60%, and gas and fertilizer prices have more than doubled. The worlds poorest countries tend to be net food importers and export and import measures on trade can further exacerbate rising food prices. At current price levels, FAO estimates increases in undernourishment and food insecurity.\nTherefore, as the UN Secretary-General has aptly put it, the war has launched a silent assault on the developing world. The Caribbean is not excluded from this assault. And while Belize and Guyana might be excluded, to some extent, from CARICOM countries that will experience food shortages and high prices for food imports, no other CARICOM country will be spared the undernourishment and food insecurity that will ensue. But Guyana and Belize will suffer from wheat shortages because Russia and Ukraine provide around 30 per cent of the worlds wheat and barley, one fifth of its maize, and over half of its sunflower oil. Also, together, Russia and Ukraine account for a fifth of the worlds fertilizers which are now either not being produced or are not being exported. Consequently, the agriculture sector in all CARICOM countries, including Guyana and Belize will decline.\nOrdinarily, countries in the Caribbean would look to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) to assist with the grave financial challenges that will, undoubtedly, flow from this deeply troubling situation  the full impact of which has not yet been felt and is, perhaps, clouding popular perception of the clear dangers that are now on the regions doorstep.\nHowever, to help countries in the Caribbean cope with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the WB and the IMF extended special mechanisms for lending to low and middle-income countries. Except for Antigua and Barbuda and St Kitts and Nevis, the two institutions also provided credit to high-income countries such as Barbados and the Bahamas. In August 2021, the IMF also expanded the allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) equivalent to $650 billion to boost liquidity and reserves around the world. About $275 billion of that $650 billion went to emerging and developing countries, and low-income countries received about $21 billion.\nThe credit that was extended, while immediately helpful to the recipient countries that were confronted with a decline in income from COVIDs effects on their economies and increased expenditure, particularly in health and support for the poor and unemployed, means that the majority of CARICOM countries are now facing the limits of their borrowing capacity. It will be difficult  if not impossible  for them to find the increased resources needed to pay for skyrocketing oil prices and food. Further, the IMF has gone as far as it can go in expanding allocation of SDRs to increase liquidity and reserves.\nThe IMF and WB, whose Spring Meetings with world governments are now in session, have announced no new avenues of assistance. Thus, they are telling Caribbean countries that the increased financing needs of the Caribbean region will lead to even higher debt levels, which for some were in excess of 100 percent of GDP prior to the COVID- 19 pandemic. They have also indicated that diversification of small economies is very difficult. This means that reliance on industries such as tourism and one-crop agriculture  both of which are vulnerable to extreme Climate Change events will continue.\nSo far, however, the IMF and WB have not produced any new means to increase liquidity and fiscal space, so that governments in developing countries can invest in the poorest and most vulnerable. The countries that control the WB and IMF  the United States, Germany, France, China and Canada among them  should step up with the means for small economies to provide for their people. After all, even in this crisis, as is Climate Change and the COVID-19 pandemic, small countries were the least contributors but the biggest victims  as they are of an unjust international financial system.\nAgainst this background, it should also be clear that Russias aggression against Ukraine is a humanitarian disaster for that country but a dagger at the heart of developing countries, especially small economies. Up to 1.7 billion people  over one-fifth of humanity  are being cast into poverty, destitution and hunger on a scale not seen in decades.\nApart from the fact that Russias military aggression against Ukraine is a violation of international law that has weakened the system and left small nations bereft of the only meaningful protection that they had, the economic consequences are also now battering small countries disproportionately. This is why Russia must be sent the clear message by all the world that nothing justifies its violation of international law, including international humanitarian law and the disregard to the rules of war that have killed thousands of civilians, including children, and put the worlds economies in jeopardy.\nThe war must end, and global peace and security restored by all. Small economies must raise their hands for this cause.\n Responses and previous commentaries: www. sirronaldsanders.com\nThe writer is Antigua and Barbudas Ambassador to the United States of America and the Organization of American States.

      "body": "Comments\nWASHINGTON: Russias invasion of Ukraine has driven up financial stability risks on several fronts and will test the resilience of the global financial system at a time when interest rates are rising sharply, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned in its biannual Global Financial Stability Report on Tuesday.\nWhile there has so far been no globally systemic financial event, there are several channels through which the Ukrainian turmoil could be amplified across the system, the IMF warned.\nThose include banks and non-banks direct and indirect exposures to Russia; commodity market disruptions and increased counterparty risk; poor market liquidity and funding strains; cyberattacks and the acceleration of crypto asset use, it said.\nHigh debt could slow countries recoveries: IMF\nWhile the financial system has proven resilient to recent shocks, future shocks could be more harmful, the IMF said.\nA sudden repricing of risk resulting from an intensification of the war and the associated escalation of sanctions may expose, and interact with, some of the vulnerabilities built up during the pandemic, leading to a sharp decline in asset prices.\nGlobal banks exposure to Russia and Ukraine is relatively modest and restricted to a handful of European lenders. However, its unclear how much indirect exposure financial companies have to the conflict because disclosures are patchy and inconsistent.\nIndirect exposures from activities such as investment banking and wealth management, off-balance-sheet supply chain or commodity financing, derivatives, and contingent liabilities, could be meaningful and surprise investors when revealed, leading to a sharp rise in counterparty risk, the report said.\nIMF, World Bank, WFP and WTO urge coordinated action on food security\nDerivatives is one area of concern, said Tobias Adrian, Director of the IMFs Monetary and Capital Markets Department, which publishes the report.\nThey are very opaque and it is difficult to know to what extent theres any hidden leverage, said Adrian. The report flagged foreign exchange swaps and forward contracts as one area that could leave banks unhedged if trades have to be canceled.\nThe other concern are private markets, private debt, private equity. There could be exposures that we dont see.\nThe market is already reeling from extensive Western sanctions which have reduced financing and pushed up the price of many major commodities including oil.\nThe report also said the handful of dealer banks that provide commodities financing had the potential to create commodity market disruptions.\nAdrian noted that roughly five commodity trading houses and five dealer banks dominate the market, creating concentration risk. We do worry somewhat about commodity markets, he added.\nIMF",

      "body": "A conversation with Tony Blair never fails to be fascinating, as he is one of the few veterans of Western politics who is still a global player thanks to his solid opinions and active engagement.\r\nSpeaking to Kathimerini at the recent Delphi Economic Forum, Blair spoke about his impressions of Vladimir Putin the first time they met and how the Russian president has changed since then. He also presented his assessment of the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the new cold war that seems to be looming on the horizon.\r\nThe former British prime minister expanded on the question of whether democracy is under threat and capitalism needs to correct the great inequalities and distortions that have emerged, giving answers that demonstrate why he is regarded as one of the most open and vibrant minds of this era.\r\nYou were probably the first Western leader to meet Vladimir Putin some time ago. Could you recall your first impressions and how would you say he has changed?\r\nI knew Putin in what I would call two incarnations. And the anxiety that I have now, is that were witnessing a third. The first was the leader I met just before he took office. He insisted the meeting was in Saint Petersburg. So it was very Western facing. He was focused on reform of the Russian economy. He wanted good relations with the West. And indeed, contrary to some of the things he said recently, we tried to bring those about. Remember the G7 was the G8, during my time. And we tried to bring Russia into the dialogue with NATO indeed. That was the first incarnation.\r\nThe second was towards the end of my time in office, when he had started to remove the checks and balances within Russian democracy and obviously had surrounded himself with a group of people who were at very tight control. So he had become a much more dictatorial figure. But though he was quite brutal, he was also calculating.\r\nThe third incarnation. What makes me anxious is that there is a third incarnation, and I cant imagine the Putin of that earlier time making such a gross miscalculation as this. To miscalculate in this way means that youve surrounded yourself with a small group of people who will not tell you anything you dont want to hear. And one of the most important attributes of leadership is that you understand youve got to have a team around you thats prepared to challenge, and thats prepared to question, and with whom you can have a proper debate. But what has happened is that, clearly, that is not the case. And believing you would go into Ukraine, and the Ukrainians would not fight to defend their territories is an extraordinary misjudgment. [The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change] has a project in Ukraine, so Ive been there virtually every year since leaving office. Anybody who goes and meets the younger generation of Ukrainians or the younger ministers in the Ukrainian government would know that they were going to fight. There was never any way that they were going to concede it this way. So those were the experiences I had when I was in office, and thats my worry.\r\nIf you go back and you revisit that whole period, do you think there was anything the West could have done better in terms of dealing with Putin? Either bringing him closer to Europe or perhaps being tougher towards him?\r\nI think about that a lot, and youve got to think about this question self-critically. We didnt fully appreciate how detached he was becoming from the West, how hostile he was becoming. I used to have this conversation with him and I said: Look, you think that we want to surround you in some hostile way. Basically, the Wests attitude to Russia is lets all get on. We got other things to do. We got economies to sort out. We got problems in our healthcare systems, our education. We want to get on with all that. And were also fighting against terrorism. So, I think it is important to say that this idea that the West was, in some way, intrinsically hostile or starting from a position of hostility, well, when I was there, that was definitely not the case. On the contrary. There was huge frustration that we couldnt get into a proper working relationship. Thats why, in recent years, Ive always said to people when they ask me about Russia that, although I can give you a very clear analysis of virtually any country on the planet, when it comes to Russia, I never know whether to be worried or very worried. And today obviously, Im very worried. But I still cant entirely figure it out even now. But anyway, whats happened is a terrible thing and a terrible tragedy. But what will come out of this, I think, is that long-term Putins position will be weakened, possibly fatally. And long term, I have absolutely no doubt at all, Ukraine will emerge as a strong independent country, with a likely path to Europe.\r\nSo you think a palace coup is possible within the Kremlin?\r\nI dont know. Youd have to you have to consult the Oracle here. Ive literally no idea. By the way, there are very few people, and Im not one of them, with the expertise to judge that inner circle and what might happen. Though what is very clear to me, is that there may be a minority of Russians, but that minority that has access to the outside world, that is connected on the internet, they will be shocked and appalled at this. And the Russians that I do know, outside of Russia, are devastated by it, because this will, over time, cripple the Russian economy and make the country in a pariah state for the time that Putin is there. So what benefit there is for Russia? This I really cant see either.\r\nOne unexpected outcome of all this is the US coming closer to Europe. Do you think this is momentary? Its going to be lasting for a while? Do you see a joint defense effort?\r\nI think it is a big moment. And a pivotal moment. And so my answer would be yes, most likely, because I think America is going to see this in the context, not just of Russia, but of China, of the way the worlds developing and will realize that that transatlantic Alliance that was born out of different times and different circumstances, has renewed relevance today. I do think that. And I think President Biden has actually done really well in pulling the West together. But I think its also going to revive Europe in a big way too, because one of the things that will emerge from this, is that democracies will rediscover a belief in their own system. And I think thats important, and I can see that happening.\r\nI want to go further into this democracy under challenge threat. But I want to ask you what happens if Trump is re-elected or another Trump-like leader is elected the US? Because thats possible. And as you know Trump was a big wake-up call for Europe, people got really scared here.\r\nI study American politics a lot. I think, irrespective of who is leader, there is going to be a public opinion push in the US, to make sure that the US and Europe are together. I think whoever is president is going to have to take account of that. And its worth poin",

Above all, it makes it makes it impossible to characterize these deaths as collateral damage.\nRussia has maintained a proxy war in Ukraines eastern Donbas region and occupied Crimea for eight years. But the reaction to Bucha in Ukraine has been far stronger than to any event since 2014; previous violence against civilians was never so brutal or intentional. The targeting of Ukrainian civilians has drawn comparisonto the mass killing of more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys by Serbian forces at Srebrenica in 1995. Others have\nweighed\nBucha against tragedies in Ukraines own history: the Holodomor, the Ukrainian name for the man-made Soviet famine of 1932-33; and the Babyn Yar massacre, in which Nazi forces murdered tens of thousands of Jews in Kyiv over a two-day period in 1941.\nSuch comparisons emphasize that shared trauma can shape identity and collective memory over generations. The Holodomoris central to Ukraines idea of itself as a country that defies Russian domination and a potent counterargument to Putins claim that Russians and Ukrainians are one people. Although Soviet authorities attempted to suppress informationabout the famine, the act of remembering the suffering intentionally inflicted on Ukrainians eventually became a core feature of national identity, both under Soviet rule and after Ukraines independence.\nThe killings in Bucha seem destined to occupy a similarly important space for future generations. It is therefore important for Ukraine to act now to preserve information, artifacts, and testimony related to the event and to consider how to memorialize the victims of the tragedy. The war is still in its first months, and there may be more horrific discoveries in other areas as Ukraine reestablishes control over places once occupied by Russian forces or where fighting still continues, such as the southern port of Mariupol. The possibility of additional atrocities deepens the psychological wound of Russias invasion; Bucha nonetheless remains the most vivid act of inhumanity.\nRussias alleged crimes in Ukraine have triggered calls for accountability in international courts. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is investigatingRussian actions in Ukraine and will invariably focus on the atrocities in Bucha. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also signaled the creation of a special mechanismto supplement any cases brought before an international tribunal that would hold all perpetrators accountable. Democracies around the world should support Ukraines quest for accountability though national and international processes. Like the evidence presented at the Nuremberg trials, information gathered during war crimes investigations in Ukraine may contribute to the construction of national memory as well as to immediate accountability for the perpetrators and their backers.\nHowever, further efforts are necessary to construct meaning from this collective trauma. Although Ukraine still faces an existential threat from Russias invasion, it is critical to collect and catalogue images, testimony, and items from Bucha and elsewhere to preserve the memory of those who were killed and foster a collective understanding of the crimes. Researchsuggests that collective trauma can lead to the construction of narratives, identities, and values that protect the victim group in the long run. In other words, a society that comes to terms with past trauma can grow stronger because of it.\nAs Ukraine embarks on this endeavor, it should incorporate lessons from ongoing yet flawed efforts to memorialize other tragedies. The development of a memorial complex at Babyn Yar intended to be on par with sites in Israel and the United States, was marred by the involvement of Russian financial backersand a design criticizedfor failing to honor victims dignity. Another plan seeks to honor the more than 100 people who died amid Ukrainian state-sponsored violenceduring the 2013-14 revolution. The failure of the judiciary to hold perpetrators accountable has upended construction efforts; developing the site threatensto get in the way of gat",

      "body": "LinkedIn\nWASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday (Apr 19) slashed its forecast for global economic growth by nearly a full percentage point, citing Russia's war in Ukraine, and warning that inflation was now a \"clear and present danger\" for many countries.\nThe war is expected to further increase inflation, the IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook, warning that a further tightening of Western sanctions on Russia to target energy exports would cause another major drop in global output.\nThe IMF said other risks to the outlook include a sharper-than-expected deceleration in China prompted by a flare-up of COVID-19 lockdowns.\nRising prices for food, energy and other goods could trigger social unrest, particularly in vulnerable developing countries, the IMF said.\nDowngrading its forecasts for the second time this year, the the global crisis lender said it now projects global growth of 3.6 per cent in both 2022 and 2023, a drop of 0.8 and 0.2 percentage point, respectively, from its January forecast due to the war's direct impacts on Russia and Ukraine and global spillovers.\nMedium-term global growth is expected to decline to about 3.3 per cent over the medium-term, compared to an average of 4.1 per cent in the period from 2004 to 2013, and growth of 6.1 per cent in 2021.\n\"What has Russia's invasion of Ukraine cost? A crisis on top of a crisis, with devastating human costs and a massive setback for the global economy,\" IMF Managing Director Kristalina told a food security panel on Tuesday.\nWAR IMPACTS\nThe IMF has estimated that Ukraine's GDP will collapse by 35 per cent this year, while Russia's output will shrink by 8.5 per cent in 2022, while emerging and developing Europe, including both countries, will contract by 2.9 per cent.\nBut IMF Chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told a news briefing that a tightening of sanctions against Russia to include restrictions on energy exports could double Russia's GDP decline to 17 per cent by 2023.\nThe European Union, highly dependent on Russian energy, saw its 2022 growth forecast cut by 1.1 percentage points, while Britain now faces slower economic growth and more persistent inflation than any other major economy next year.\nSpillovers from higher energy prices, a loss of confidence and financial market turmoil from this step would cut another two percentage points off of global growth forecasts, Gourinchas said.\nThe war, which Russia describes as a \"special military operation\" has caused a humanitarian crisis in Eastern Europe, displacing some 5 million Ukrainians to neighbouring countries, the IMF said.\nThe war has exacerbated inflation that already had been rising in many countries due to imbalances in supply and demand linked to the pandemic, with the latest lockdowns in China likely to cause new bottlenecks in global supply chains.\nGourinchas said central banks face increased pressure to fight inflation with tighter monetary policy, and a further tightening of sanctions could accelerate this move, which could cause more difficulties for developing economies.\n\"The war adds to the series of supply shocks that have struck the global economy in recent years. Like seismic waves, its effects will propagate far and wide - through commodity markets, trade, and financial linkages,\" Gourinchas said.\nReduced supplies of oil, gas and metals produced by Russia, and wheat and corn - produced by both Russia and Ukraine - had driven up prices sharply in Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa, but was hurting lower-income households around the world.\nThe IMF said it had revised downward its medium-term outlook for all groups, except commodity exporters who benefit from the surge in energy and food prices.\n'CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER'\nThe IMF said inflation was now projected to remain higher for longer, driven by war-induced commodity price increases and broadening price pressures, and it warned the situation could get worse if supply-demand imbalances deepened.\nFor 2022, it forecast inflation of 5.7 per cent in advanced economies and 8.7 per cent in emerging market and developing economies, a jump of 1.8 and 2.8 percentage points from January's forecast.\n\"Inflation has become a clear and present danger for many countries,\" Gourinchas said.\nHe said the US Federal Reserve and many other central banks had already moved toward tightening monetary policy, but war-related disruptions were amplifying those pressures.\nThe IMF said there was a rising risk that inflation expectations become de-anchored, prompting a more aggressive tightening response, which could put pressure on a wider range of emerging market economies.\nFinancial conditions tightened for emerging markets and developing countries immediately after the invasion and the repricing has been \"mostly orderly,\" but further tightening was possible, as well as capital outflows.\nThe war had also increased the risk of a more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocks with distinct technology standards, cross-border payment systems, and reserve currencies, a move Gourinchas said would be a \"disaster\".\nSource: Reuters/ec",

If successful, that offensive would give President Vladimir Putin a vital piece of Ukraine and a badly needed victory in the now 7-week-old war.\nEXPLAINER: How Russia's eastern push in Ukraine may unfold\nRussias new offensive in eastern Ukraine reflects Moscows hope to reverse its battlefield fortunes after a catastrophic seven weeks of war. Russian forces have intensified artillery barrages and airstrikes on Ukrainian positions in the industrial heartland known as the Donbas. Ukrainian officials said the push began Monday, with Russia trying to press the offensive along an arc-shaped front line for more than 300 miles (480 kilometers) from the northeast to the southeast. In what appeared to be a sharp increase in bombardment Tuesday, Russia said that in the last 24 hours, it struck 60 Ukrainian military facilities with its warplanes and 1,260 with its artillery, while attacking 1,214 troop concentrations. The claims could not be independently confirmed.\nFlyers, subway riders shed masks: 'Feel free to burn them'\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP)  Travelers cheered and stripped off their masks as pilots announced over the loudspeaker that a federal judge in Florida had struck down a national mask mandate on airplanes and mass transit. The judges decision Monday freed airlines, airports and mass transit systems to make their own decisions about mask requirements, resulting in a mix of responses. Major airlines and airports in places like Dallas, Atlanta and Los Angeles quickly switched to a mask optional policy. New York City was one of the few holdouts to continue requiring masks in its airports and on its public transit system.\n'Not my life': An apartment block reflects the new Ukraine\nLVIV, Ukraine (AP)  The Soviet-era apartment blocks at the end of a tram line in this western Ukrainian city show an indifferent face to the world, blank and gray. But behind every lighted window is a story, never so much as now. Lviv on the surface looks calm, too. But the city is uniquely representative of the 10 million people displaced inside Ukraine since Russias invasion, absorbing at least 500,000 new residents. The Associated Press visited one apartment building that holds families from some of Ukraines most devastated communities. The families dont know each other, but they can recognize displaced people like themselves on sight, without exchanging a word.\nExpert: Gun pressed to Patrick Lyoya's head when cop fired\nDETROIT (AP)  A Michigan police officer who killed Patrick Lyoya after a traffic stop pressed the gun against the Black mans head when firing the fatal shot. That's the opinion of an expert who performed an independent autopsy on Patrick Lyoya. The results were announced Tuesday. Dr. Werner Spitz says he confirmed what was seen last week on video: Lyoya was shot in the back of the head in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on April 4. Attorney Ben Crump says the white officer failed to ease up after a foot chase and physical struggle following a traffic stop. Results of the official autopsy havent been publicly released. State police are investigating the shooting.\nGun safety activists decry inaction as US shootings surge\nNEW YORK (AP)  Democrats have spent years pledging to address the gun violence that plagues communities across the U.S. But a surge of mass shootings over the weekend served as a reminder of how little has been accomplished. The struggle for the Biden administration and Democrats in Congress to enact meaningful legislation to enhance gun safety reflects how the partys ambitious agenda has been frustratingly stunted. The almost complete Republican opposition to Democratic priorities has hobbled a party with razor-thin majorities in the House and Senate. But thats little solace to gun safety advocates and tens of thousands of shooting victims who were told Democrats would reduce gun violence if given the chance to govern.\nModerna announces step toward updating COVID shots for fall\nModerna hopes to offer updated COVID-19 boosters in the fall that combine the original vaccine with protection against the latest variant. Now it's reporting a hint that such an approach might work. Before omicron struck, Moderna began testing a shot combining the original vaccine with protection against an earlier variant named beta. The company says people given that test combo shot developed more antibodies capable of fighting newer variants  including omicron  than today's regular booster. Studies are underway to see if a combination shot that adds omicron-specific protection works better.\nStudy: Redlining tied to more oil, gas wells in urban areas\nA new study finds that minority neighborhoods where residents were long denied home loans through a practice called redlining have twice as many oil and gas wells as mostly white neighborhoods. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and Columbia University compared home loan maps created in the 1930s in 33 U.S. cities to records of oil and gas wells dating to the late 1800s.  Authors of the study published last week in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology say their findings suggest that ongoing health risks in Black and Latino communities are at least partly tied to historical structural racism.\nLatest apps promise fast service but can they deliver?\nNEW YORK (AP)  Venture capitalists have poured billions into the latest pandemic delivery craze: companies that promise to get you a bottle of Tylenol, an iced coffee, hummus, a cucumber and a roll of paper towels. In 30 minutes or less  or even 15 minutes or less. Experts say they're unprofitable. Bigger companies are muscling in. And officials in European cities and in New York, which has become the U.S. launching pad, have already started complaining about how they operate, saying its bad for employees and residents. Services are already shutting down, cutting workers or scaling back their fast-delivery promises.\nJohnny Depp on stand: Ex-wife Heard's allegations 'heinous'\nFAIRFAX, Va. (AP)  Actor Johnny Depp took the stand Tuesday in his libel lawsuit against his ex-wife Amber Heard, saying her domestic abuse allegations against him were disturbing, heinous and not based in any species of truth. Depp says Heard falsely accused him of domestic abuse when she wrote an op-ed piece in The Washington Post back in 2018. The trial in Fairfax, Virginia, began last week but, prior to Tuesday afternoon, the jury had only seen Depp sitting ",

Saturday's strikes are a reminder to Ukrainians and their Western supporters that the whole country remains under threat despite a pivot toward a new offensive in the east. Moscow says the renewed attacks targeted Ukrainian military sites. But each day brings more civilian victims of a war that has shattered European security.

The six lawmakers met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday morning and were also scheduled to meet with the islands defense minister.

Maksym Marchenko said Ukrainian forces struck the guided-missile cruiser Moskva  the flagship of Russias Black Sea Fleet  with two missiles and caused serious damage.

That warning followed the stunning loss of Moscows flagship in the Black Sea, which a senior U.S. official confirmed was hit by a Ukrainian missile. Amid its threats, Moscow continues preparations for a renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine. Fighting also continues in the pummeled southern port city of Mariupol.\nRiots in Sweden against far-right group leave 3 injured\nSwedish police say they have fired warning shots during a riot in Norrkoping to disperse protesters angry about demonstrations over the past several days by a Danish anti-Islam group in Sweden.

But experts and Russians alike say Johnson's appeal  and his proposed solution  may not make much of a dent in the course of the war.\nRussia shuttered independent news outlets at the start of the war and imposed new, stricter censorship laws that have restricted the Russian public's already-limited access to verified outside information.\nZachary Steinert-Threlkeld\n, assistant professor of public policy at the Luskin School of Public Affairs at UCLA, in an interview with Insider, estimated that only about 10% of Russia's population currently has access to VPNsor virtual private networks that encrypt information you send over the internet. Steinert-Threlkeld, who studies subnational conflicts and Ukraine, posited that those who do are mainly young, educated people living in major cities.\nThat means a large portion of Russia's population is getting their news and information exclusively from state-run media, Steinert-Threlkeld said.\n\"Since the start of the war, the media landscape, you should think of something like Chinese media or North Korea. Not as extreme as North Korea, but completely state-controlled and state dictated,\" he explained. \"It was already state-dominated before, but at this point, there's nothing that's not state-approved or follows the state line because of self-censorship.\"\nNatalia Konstantinova, a popular\nRussian vlogger\nwho lives in Saint Petersburg, told Insider that this is especially true for older Russian citizens who primarily get their news from Russian television channels, which exclusively spew state-sponsored propaganda about Russia's \"special operation\" in Ukraine.\nYounger Russians, however, spend more time reading the internet, which offers more opportunities for them to encounter opposing views, Konstantinova said. They also tend to be more technologically adept, using VPNs to avoid Russian state internet blocks and ostensibly accessing independent information and news.\nBut VPNs are 'definitely not going to solve the information warfare in Russia,' according to one expert\nMarc Faddoul, an AI researcher, who runs the TikTok Observatory told Insider that VPNs, while undeniably beneficial, also have some major limitations.\n\"The benefit is that once you have a\nVPN\n, obviously you can access most of the internet as you would from outside of Russia,\" Faddoul told Insider.\n\"The limitation is that it's kind of something for advanced users,\" he continued, adding that \"when you're already getting to this length to go downloading a VPN, it's because you're aware that there is a kind of censored information ecosystem around you.\"\nKonstantinova, who uses her VPN to access international news, echoed Faddoul's comments, acknowledging that most Russians are not incentivized to use the technological loophole as a gateway to getting non-Russian information. She said most people she knows utilize VPNs to access Instagram and other blocked social media apps  not to find verified news about Ukraine.\n\"You need to understand that before people search, they need to have a question. They need to doubt,\" said Konstantinova, who cited her English-language skills, international friends, and innately skeptical demeanor as reasons for her active pursuit of independent information.\nBut even for those who do regularly access outside news outlets, there's not much they can do with the information they're digesting. Steinert-Threlkeld said the atmosphere in Russia is \"much more similar to Soviet times,\" when people could not speak openly and could only trust a few people.\n\"So even if you do read about Boris Johnson on BBC maybe you only tell the two or three people you trust as opposed to talking about it openly in a cafe or talking to some stranger on the subway,\" he said. \"Because of the atmosphere of fear and oppression, it constricts with the willingness of people to take a risk and speak openly. So it constricts the movement of information.\"\nKonstantinova said she plays such a role within her own social circle.\nprovides insight into average Russian life geared toward foreigners. But her Russian friends  most of whom have their own VPN access  rely on her to keep them updated about the conflict in Ukraine, she said.\nAn iPhone screen shows a Telegram account.\nAP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko\nSome Russians have access to other loopholes\nSteinert-Threlkeld warned that while VPNs work well on browsers and laptops, they don't block someone's location on apps or a smartphone. Apps on a phone transmit someone's location based on GPS in the phone's operating system. So people accessing apps even while using a VPN aren't protected from having their location revealed.\nRussia could block a popular VPN in an effort to crack down on censorship, Faddoul said, but anecdotal evidence in other heavily-monitored countries suggests more VPNs quickly pop up in response  a reality that Konstantinova said occurred in Russia earlier this month when citizens discovered that one of the most popular VPNs had been blocked.\nBut some Russian citizens are lucky enough to avoid the headache and hassle of VPNs altogether, thanks to a different access loophole.\nKonstantinova said many internet providers are defying Russian censorship laws, by ignoring internet blocks and allowing users to access what should be censored content. Each residential building has its own internet provider  some large and Russian-owned; others smaller and more independent. A lax internet provider is how Konstantinova said she and several of her friends in Moscow regularly access blocked content online in their own homes.\nDespite theclampdown on independent media and Western appsKonstantinova said most Russians aren't afraid to use VPNs or access rogue internet providers amid the Ukrainian conflict because t",

      "body": "Russia pours in more troops and presses attack in the east\nBy Associated Press|\nApril 19, 2022 at 12:19 p.m.\n| UPDATED:\nApril 19, 2022 at 12:19 p.m.\nBy ADAM SCHRECK\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP)  Russia assaulted cities and towns along a boomerang-shaped front hundreds of miles long and poured more troops into Ukraine on Tuesday in a potentially pivotal battle for control of the countrys eastern industrial heartland of coal mines and factories.\nIf successful, the Russian offensive in what is known as the Donbas would essentially slice Ukraine in two and give President Vladimir Putin a badly needed victory after the failed attempt by Moscows forces to storm the capital, Kyiv, and heavier-than-expected casualties nearly two months into the war.\nThe cities of Kharkiv and Kramatorsk came under deadly attack, and Russia also said it struck areas around Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro west of the Donbas with missiles.\nRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said air-launched missiles destroyed 13 Ukrainian troop and weapons locations, while the air force struck 60 other Ukrainian military facilities, including missile warhead storage depots.\nRussian artillery hit nearly 1,300 Ukrainian military facilities and over 1,200 troop concentrations over the past 24 hours, Konashenkov said. The claims could not be independently verified.\nIn what both sides described as a new phase of the war, the Russian assault began Monday along a front stretching more than 300 miles (480 kilometers) from northeastern Ukraine to the countrys southeast. Ukraines military said Russian forces tried to break through our defenses along nearly the entire front line.\nWeeks ago, after the abortive Russian push to take Kyiv, the Kremlin declared that its main goal was the capture of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years.\nA Russian victory in the Donbas would deprive Ukraine of the industrial assets concentrated there, including mines, metals plants and heavy-equipment factories.\nA senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagons assessments of the war, said the Russians had added two more combat units, known as battalion tactical groups, in Ukraine over the preceding 24 hours. That brought the total number of units in the country to 78, all of them the south and the east, up from 65 last week, the official said.\nThat would translate to about 55,000 to 62,000 troops, based on what the Pentagon said at the start of the war was the typical unit strength of 700 to 800 soldiers. But accurately determining Russias fighting capacity at this stage is difficult.\nA European official, likewise speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments, said Russia also has 10,000 to 20,000 foreign fighters in the Donbas. They are a mix of mercenaries from Russias private Wagner Group and Russian proxy fighters from Syria and Libya, according to the official.\nWhile Ukraine portrayed the attacks on Monday as the start of the long-feared offensive in the east, some observers noted that an escalation has been underway there for some time and questioned whether this was truly the start of a new offensive.\nThe U.S. official said that the offensive in the Donbas has begun in a limited way, mainly in an area southwest of the city of Donetsk and south of Izyum.\nJustin Crump, a former British tank commander now with the strategic advisory company Sibylline, said the Ukrainian comments could, in part, be an attempt to persuade allies to send more weapons.\nWhat theyre trying to do by positioning this, I think, is  focus peoples minds and effort by saying, Look, the conflict has begun in the Donbas, Crump said. That partly puts pressure on NATO and EU suppliers to say, Guys, were starting to fight now. We need this now.\nEuropean and American arms have played a key role in enabling the outgunned Ukrainians to hold off the Russians. The Dutch prime minister told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday that the Netherlands would send heavier material, including armored vehicles.\nAssociated Press journalists in Kharkiv said at least four people were killed and three wounded in a Russian attack on a residential area of the city. The attack occurred as residents attempted to maintain a sense of normalcy, with municipal workers planting spring flowers in public areas.\nAn explosion also rocked Kramatorsk, killing at least one person and wounding three, according to AP journalists at the scene.\nEyewitness accounts and reports from officials have given a broad picture of the extent of the Russian advance. But independent reporting in the parts of the Donbas held by Russian forces and separatists is severely limited, making it difficult to know what is happening in many places on the ground.\nMilitary experts said the Russians goal is to encircle Ukrainian troops from the north, south and east.\nKey to the campaign is the capture of Mariupol, the now-devastated city in the Donbas that the Russians have besieged since the early days of the war. Taking Mariupol would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, seized from Ukraine from 2014.\nIt would also free up Russian troops to move elsewhere in the Donbas.\nA few thousand Ukrainian troops, by the Russians estimate, remained holed up in a sprawling Mariupol steel plant, representing what was believed to be the last major pocket of resistance in the city.\nOn Tuesday, Russia issued a new ultimatum to the Ukrainian defenders to surrender, saying those who come out will keep their lives, and said a cease-fire was being declared in the area so the combatants could leave the plant.\nThe Ukrainians have ignored previous such offers, and there was no immediate confirmation a cease-fire occurred.\nThe Kremlin-backed leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, whose forces have taken part in the fighting in Mariupol, said on a messaging app that Russian forces would root out the Ukrainian resistance within hours and take full control of the steel mill on Tuesday.\nKadyrov is known for his bluster and has repeatedly predicted the citys fall in the past.\n___\nAssociated Press journalists Mstyslav Chernov and Felipe Dana in Kharkiv, Ukraine; Danica Kirka in London; and Robert Burns in Washington contributed to this report, as did other AP staff members around the world.\n___",

He stressed the value of discretion in one of his few public mentions of his daughters.\n\"I never discuss my family with anyone.\" Putin told reporters at a 2015 news conference, according to the BBC.\nPutin married Lyudmila Shkrebneva in the 1980s when he was a KGB agent and she was an Aeroflot flight attendant. They divorced three decades later.\nOldest daughter Maria is a medical researcher and reportedly a businesswoman and developer.\nYounger daughter Katerina was a competitive dancer turned tech developer, appearing publicly at performances and in occasional tech conferences.\nSo far, sanctions have not been imposed on the woman named in news reports as Putins longtime romantic partner.

As British tabloids noted, Kabaevas photo and name recently disappeared from the website of the National Media Group as sanctions on Putins intimates neared.\nFollowing Russia's attack that began Feb. 24, Canada has imposed sanctions on more than 700 individuals and entities from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.\nWant to get a head start on your day?\nGet the days breaking stories, weather forecast, and more sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning.\nSign Up\nI agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies and CASL agreement\nLast week, sanctions targeted organizations that have provided support to the Russian military  directly or indirectly  including the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Integral SPB and Shipyard Vympel JSC.\nThe EU has introduced a series of sanctions as well, targeting Russias lucrative energy industry with an embargo on coal imports, along with a transaction ban on four key Russian banks representing 23 per cent of market share in the Russian banking sector.\nThe 27-nation bloc also banned vessels registered under the Russian flag from EU ports, with an exception for agricultural and food products, humanitarian aid and energy.\nSince Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, Canada has levied sanctions on more than 1,100 individuals and entities.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 19, 2022.\n With files from Jordan Press and The Associated Press\nAdvertisement",

      "body": "LinkedIn\nKYIV: Thousands of Russian troops backed by artillery and rocket barrages began a long-anticipated offensive in eastern Ukraineon Tuesday (Apr 19), prompting Western countries to pledge more arms and money to the Kyiv government.\nUkrainian officials said their soldiers would withstand the assault, calling it the Battle of the Donbas But the Russians pressed an advance across almost the entire stretch of the eastern front and, hours after its start, seized a frontline city.\nIn the ruins of Mariupol, the southeastern port that has suffered nearly eight weeks of siege, Russia gave the last Ukrainian defenders holed up in a steel works an ultimatum to surrender by noon or die. The deadline passed without word of their fate.\nKyiv's lead negotiator said it was hard to predict when peace talks might resume because of the Mariupol siege and the new offensive.\nIn a swift response to the intensified assault, US President Joe Biden and other Western leaders discussed increasing military, economic and humanitarian support for the Kyiv government, and ways to hold Moscow accountable, the White House said.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Berlin intended to supply Ukraine with anti-tank and air defence weapons as well as long-range artillery weapons, and Britain's prime minister, Boris Johnson, also promised more artillery weapons as the conflict moved into a new phase.\nScholz said the allies agreed Russia must not win the war, and that an imposed peace as envisaged by Russian President Vladimir Putin was not acceptable.\nThe Italian government said there had been \"broad consensus on the need to step up pressure on the Kremlin, including by adopting further sanctions, and to increase Moscow's international isolation\".\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a four-day humanitarian pause in the fighting over the Orthodox Easter weekend to allow civilians to leave areas of conflict and humanitarian aid to be delivered.\nCITY CAPTURED\nUkraine said the new assault had resulted in the capture of Kreminna an administrative centre of 18,000 people in Luhansk, one of the two Donbas provinces.\nRussian forces were attacking \"on all sides\", authorities were trying to evacuate civilians and it was impossible to tally the civilian dead, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Ukrainians in a video address overnight: \"No matter how many Russian troops they send there, we will fight. We will defend ourselves.\"\nA woman pulls a wheel chair while transporting an injured man in a street in the course of Ukraine-Russia conflict in the southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine April 18, 2022.

Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/via Reuters TV/Handout via REUTERS\nIn Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov confirmed that \"another stage of this operation is beginning\". Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia was \"methodically\" carrying out its plan to \"liberate\" Donetsk and Luhansk, provinces which Moscow demands Kyiv cede fully to Russian-backed separatists.\nDriven back by Ukrainian forces in March from an assault on Kyiv in the north, Russia has instead poured troops into the east for the Donbas offensive. It has also made long-distance strikes at other targets including the capital.\nUkraine's top security official, Oleksiy Danilov, said Russian forces had tried to break through Ukrainian defences \"along almost the entire front line of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions\".\nThe coal- and steel-producing Donbas has been the focal point of Russia's campaign to destabilise Ukraine since 2014, when the Kremlin used proxies to set up separatist \"people's republics\" in parts of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces.\nMoscow now says its aim is to capture the full provinces on the separatists' behalf. Ukraine has a large force defending northern parts of the Donbas and military experts say Russia aims to cut them off or surround them.\nBut Russia still needs to keep its troops supplied across miles of hostile territory. Ukraine has counter-attacked near Kharkiv in the rear of Russia's advance, apparently aiming to cut off supply lines.\nSince starting what it calls a special operation to demilitarise Ukraine on Feb 24, Russia has bombed cities to rubble and hundreds of civilian bodies have been found in towns where its forces withdrew. It denies targeting civilians and says, without evidence, that signs of atrocities were staged.\nWestern countries and Ukraine accuse Putin of unprovoked aggression.\nSHELL-SHOCKED RESIDENTS\nIn Mariupol, scene of the war's heaviest fighting and worst humanitarian catastrophe, a last group of Ukrainian defenders holding out in the Azovstal steel works defied Russian calls to surrender and be spared.\nHowever, about 120 civilians living next to the sprawling plant left via humanitarian corridors, the Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday, quoting Russian state TV.\nThe pro-Kremlin leader of Chechnya, whose forces have been fighting in Mariupol, predicted troops would capture the plant on Tuesday.\nMariupol has been besieged since the war's early days. Tens of thousands of residents have been trapped with no access to food or water and bodies litter the streets. Ukraine believes more than 20,000 civilians have died there.\nCapturing it would link pro-Russian separatist territory with the Crimea region that Moscow annexed in 2014.\nIn Russian-held districts reached by Reuters, shell-shocked residents cooked on open fires outside their damaged homes.\n\"Obviously, against the backdrop of the Mariupol tragedy, the negotiation process has become even more complicated,\" Ukraine's lead negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak told Reuters.\nKyiv and Moscow have not held face-to-face talks since Mar 29. Each side blames the other for their breakdown.\n\"It is difficult to say when the next face-to-face round of negotiations will be possible because the Russians are seriously betting on the so-called 'second stage of the special operation',\" Podolyak said.\nShells and rockets also hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, local officials said, wrecking apartment blocks and other buildings. Four people were killed and 14 wounded, they said.\nReuters journalists saw the bodies of three people apparently killed by shrapnel lying on the pavement.\n\"They are sabotaging the whole city,\" said 79-year-old Fyodor Bondarenko, watching as one body was carried into an ambulance while the crump of shelling sounded in the background.\nSource: Reuters/ec",

As a rabbi, I am naturally seized on the suffering and uncertain fate of Ukrainian Jews. But my concern extends to Ukrainians of all faiths who are scrambling to survive the indiscriminate onslaught.\nOne group that has not received the attention they deserve are the Crimean Tatars, a people whom I have engaged with on the interfaith level during my years of interfaith diplomacy with the Muslim world.\nThe Crimean Tatars, largely Muslims, trace their history in the Ukrainian peninsula back many centuries, most of which are marked indelibly by Russian oppression.\ncnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });\nconsole.log(\"catid body is \"+catID);if(catID==120){document.getElementsByClassName(\"divConnatix\")[0].style.display =\"none\";var script = document.createElement('script'); script.src = 'https://player.anyclip.com/anyclip-widget/lre-widget/prod/v1/src/lre.js'; script.setAttribute('pubname','jpostcom'); script.setAttribute('widgetname','0011r00001lcD1i_12258'); document.getElementsByClassName('divAnyClip')[0].appendChild(script);}else if(catID!=69 && catID!=2){ document.getElementsByClassName(\"divConnatix\")[0].style.display =\"none\"; var script = document.createElement('script'); script.src = 'https://static.vidazoo.com/basev/vwpt.js'; script.setAttribute('data-widget-id','60fd6becf6393400049e6535'); document.getElementsByClassName('divVidazoo')[0].appendChild(script); }\nRussia first violated an international treaty to annex Crimea in 1783. But the Tatars misery grew in May 1944, when Josef Stalin had the Soviet Union deport Crimean Tatars from their homeland. They were forced to Central Asia in cattle cars, a campaign that resulted in the loss of 46% of their population to starvation, exhaustion and disease. Those who survived were often sent to Gulag camps.\nA Russian flag flies on the bank of the Black Sea during celebrations for the first anniversary of the Crimean treaty signing in Sevastopol, March 18, 2015. (credit: MAXIM SHEMETOV/REUTERS)\nFollowing the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea, the Tatars were dispossessed of their lands once again, deprived of the ability to organize politically. Their assembly, or Mejlis, was banned and falsely labeled extremist. They have continued to suffer forcible disappearances and torture at the hands of Russian security services.\nFor evidence, see the Ukrainian submission to the UN International Court of Justice on Russian persecution of the Crimean Tatars, which filled 29 volumes and 17,500 pages. It makes clear their mistreatment has been one of a perverse economy of scale, and states that Russian forces recruited terrorists who carried out explosive attacks on civilians in Odesa, Kharkiv and Kyiv.\nIn the aftermath of the 2014 Russian invasion, my organization, the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding (FFEU), as part of its mission to foster closer Muslim-Jewish relations globally, sponsored a visit by leaders of the Crimean Tatar Mejlis to Washington.\nWe held discussions with US policymakers and Muslim and Jewish leaders to push back on Russian discrimination and misinformation. And we built fundraising infrastructure to provide critical relief supplies to the children of disappeared or jailed Crimean Tatar political prisoners.\nTHE TREATMENT of the Tatars foreshadowed the wider crimes of Russia in Ukraine. This month, President Joe Biden stated his belief that Russian forces are committing genocide in Ukraine and trying to wipe out the Ukrainian identity. This is not the first time.\nSoviet collectivization policies in Ukraine created a famine known as the Holodomor in 1933 that killed 10 million Ukrainians. Fourteen countries have recognized the Holodomor as a genocide.\nWe should have seen this threat coming, given Russias extensive historical mistreatment of Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars. They have warned us for many years of the Russian threat, and too few listened.\nAny Jew or Muslim in a minority context, even a world away, should feel some sense of kinship upon learning of the Tatar plight. As we use the time of Passover and Ramadan for reflection and empathy, we should focus on the injustices we see in the world and do all we can to correct them.",

Evans joined the FBI in 2004 as an agent in New Haven, Connecticut, and has held various investigative and leadership positions and headed programs in San Diego, Florida and Oklahoma City. The announcement Monday by FBI Director Christopher Wray said Evans' most recent post was as deputy assistant director in human resources at FBI Headquarters in Washington. In Las Vegas, Evans replaces Special Agent in Charge Aaron Rouse, who retired in February after 25 years with the bureau.\nRussia renews strikes on Ukraine capital, hits other cities\nRussia has resumed scattered attacks on Kyiv, western Ukraine and beyond after warning that it planned to step up missile strikes on the capital. Saturday's strikes are a reminder to Ukrainians and their Western supporters that the whole country remains under threat despite a pivot toward a new offensive in the east. Moscow says the renewed attacks targeted Ukrainian military sites. But each day brings more civilian victims of a war that has shattered European security. As Russia prepared for the anticipated offensive, a mother wept over her 15-year-old sons body. The teenager and at least eight other people died after rockets hit a residential area of the northeast city of Kharkiv.\nChina stages military exercises as US lawmakers visit Taiwan\nChina says its military has staged exercises to reinforce its threat to use force to bring Taiwan under its control, as U.S. lawmakers visiting Taiwan made a pointed and public declaration of support for the self-governing island democracy while issuing a warning to China. The six lawmakers met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday morning and were also scheduled to meet with the islands defense minister. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the drills staged by the Peoples Liberation Armys Eastern Theater Command in areas opposite Taiwan were a countermeasure to the recent negative actions of the U.S., including the visit of a delegation of lawmakers to Taiwan.\nPresidents from countries on Russia's doorstep visit Ukraine\nThe presidents of four countries on Russias doorstep have underscored their support for Ukraine in a visit to the embattled country. Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia all worry they may face Russian attack in the future if Ukraine falls. The trip Wednesday by the countries' presidents comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to continue his bloody offensive until its full completion. In the Odesa region, Gov. Maksym Marchenko said Ukrainian forces struck the guided-missile cruiser Moskva  the flagship of Russias Black Sea Fleet  with two missiles and caused serious damage. The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed the ship was damaged but not that it was hit by Ukraine  it said ammunition on board detonated as a result of a fire.\nPolice: More than 900 civilian bodies found in Kyiv region\nMore than 900 bodies of civilians were discovered in the Kyiv region following the withdrawal of Russian forces. That's according to the regional police chief, who spoke Friday. The jarring numbers emerged shortly after Russias Defense Ministry promised to ramp up missile attacks on Kyiv in response to alleged aggression on Russian territory. That warning followed the stunning loss of Moscows flagship in the Black Sea, which a senior U.S. official confirmed was hit by a Ukrainian missile. Amid its threats, Moscow continues preparations for a renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine. Fighting also continues in the pummeled southern port city of Mariupol.\nRiots in Sweden against far-right group leave 3 injured\nSwedish police say they have fired warning shots during a riot in Norrkoping to disperse protesters angry about demonstrations over the past several days by a Danish anti-Islam group in Sweden. Three people were slightly injured during the clashes. A crowd of about 150 people threw stones at officers and police vehicles and set fire to cars. Police said they responded by firing warning shots and three people seem to have been hit by ricochets and were hospitalized in Norrkoping. Police said the three were arrested and none of them had serious injuries.",

Instead, he went to school in Romania, which in 1981 was governed by a Communist regime. He decided to stay in the country after its government collapsed.\nToday the intensive-care physician leads what is effectively the country's version of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, responsible for preparing for all sorts of disasters. He still never expected to be helping lead the response to war.\n\"We were ready for floods. We were ready for earthquakes,\" Arafat said. \"None of us thought that we will see people coming from another country, which is a neighboring country, and which are all displaced because of a war in Europe. This was the biggest shock. And this is still a shock.\"\nBut the most shocking thing about it is all the orphans and other kids entering Romania without a parent, he said: \"Last week, the number was over 500 children, none accompanied.\"\nThe war in neighboring Ukraine has forced more than 740,000 people to flee through Romania, a member of NATO and the European Union that lies to the south and east of the country, with the smaller nation of Moldova sandwiched between the two.\nMost Ukrainian refugees continue on to other places  typically, those that offer more economic opportunities or have more people fluent in Ukrainian or Russian. Of the nearly 84,000 who have thus far chosen to remain, some over 37,o00 are children under the age of 18, according to the health ministry.\nChildren who arrive without a parent or guardian are taken into the custody of Romania's Child Protection System. Authorities in Ukraine, home to an estimated 100,000 orphans before Russia's February 24 invasion, are consulted to see if the children have relatives back home or elsewhere abroad; if they do not, it is likely they will stay in Romania.\nTheir arrival was a shock, but oneRomania was prepared for. In 2018, the country carried out a major exercise to test its ability to respond to an indeterminate disaster that required thousands of people to be medically evacuated. The pandemic, two years later, was almost a test run for the crisis it now faces.\nDr. Alexandru Rafila has served as Romania's Minister of Health under a unity government since November 2021.\nCharles Davis/Insider\nNuclear fears spur run on iodine\nDr. Alexandru Rafila, a physician elected to parliament as a member of the center-left Social Democratic Party, took over as health minister in November 2021, a time when bodies of fourth-wave COVID-19 victims were lining the floorsof hospitals in Romania. He now worries about the human cost of a Russian military offensive.\n\"I think one of the worst-case scenarios is to have a lot of wounded civilians,\" Rafila said in an interview at his office in Bucharest.\n\"I hope not to be in this situation, but we are prepared  we have 7,000 beds in Romania, especially for this,\" he said, noting that Ukrainians already enjoy free access to healthcare in the country at least in part due to a Soviet-era treaty between the former members of the Communist bloc.\nRomania is also prepared for a nuclear disaster, insofar as any country can be.\nThose fears have been exacerbated by fighting over the control of nuclear sites in Ukraine, including the Zaporizhzhia power plant  just a few hundred kilometers from the Romania-Ukraine border  in a region that still remembers the 1986 Chernobyl accident.\n\"There was a discussion from the beginning regarding the stocks of iodine,\" Rafila said. He said that talk \"in the public space\" about a potential radioactive incident next door, and an ensuing rush on the country's pharmaciesfor iodine pills spurred the government to hold internal discussions about the matter.\nEarlier this month, Romania's health ministry announced it was launching an information campaign on the proper use of the pills, which, in the event of a disaster, can help limit the amount of radiation absorbed by the body.\nThe national government also restocked its emergency supply of the medication and is currently weighing whether or not to distribute them directly to the populace.\n\"It's on our list of emergency stocks, and stocks should be replaced from time to time,\" Rafila said of the pills, seeking to downplay the connection to contemporary events.\nThere are a number of nuclear reactors in and around Romania, and if something were to go wrong with them, spilling radiation into the atmosphere, it might be necessary to ingest iodine.\nBut it would be less relevant in the event that, say, Russia used a nuclear weapon in Ukraine.\n\"We don't discuss nuclear war,\" Rafila said. \"You don't need iodine for a nuclear war.\"\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, United States ambassador to the United Nations gestures next to the head of Romania's Department for Emergency Situations (DSU) Raed Arafat during a visit to a help center that is assisting refugees fleeing the war from neighbouring Ukraine, in Gara de Nord, the main railway station, in Bucharest, Romania, Monday, April 4, 2022.\nAlex Micsik /Pool Photo via AP\nRomania fears influx of war casualties\nA more pressing concern is that the conventional war in Ukraine will continue. A renewed Russian military offensive in the eastern and southern parts of the country  and a fight for the Black Sea port city of Odesa  could push many more people to seek refuge in Romania, which has set aside some 3,000 surgical beds for potential war casualties.\nDr. Arafat told Insider the country is also considering setting up a new medical hub near its eastern border with Moldova, where seriously injured or otherwise ill patients could from there be evacuated to other parts of Europe.

I cannot accept that logic  a logic that leads directly to further death, further suffering, further displacement,&rdquo; Mr Coveney told the UN security council members.Mr Coveney said thatby contrast Ukrainian prime minister Volodymyr Zelensky had constantly remained open to diplomatic solutions despite Russian forces&rsquo; brutality against his people.In a direct challenge to Moscow, Mr Coveney called upon Vladimir Putin to agree an immediate ceasefire on humanitarian grounds and then engage in peace talks.The Foreign Affairs Minister said Ireland is a small country which is militarily neutral with no pretentions to being a military power.But Mr Coveney insisted this country always wanted to engage with the United Nations and had made considerable effort to win a rotating seat on its steering security council for a temporary period of two years.&ldquo;The only weapons we have are diplomacy, dialogue, facts, collective leadership, and most importantly, a shared commitment to international law and the UN charter,&rdquo; he said.Mr Coveney noted that the war in Ukraine had impacted upon the poorest of the poor across the globe  from the Middle East to Africa to Latin America. He said up to seven million people had been displaced in Ukraine with five million Ukrainians drivenbeyond their home borders.",

      "description": "Ukrainian defence forces will need new types of weaponry that their western allies have been initially slow to supply",
      "body": "\n\nThe new offensive against eastern Ukrainebegan on Monday night with Russiaunleashing a barrage of missiles and artillery fire along the line from Kharkivin the north to Mariupol in the south. In Mariupol, the citys remaining Ukrainian troops and an estimated 2,000 civilians are surrounded in the tunnels under the sprawling Azovstal steel plant, refusing demands to surrender. Food and ammunition are running low.\nThe city, a key port and a strategic Russian target to open a southern corridor to the occupied Crimean peninsula, and where Ukraine estimates 21,000 people have been killed so far, is being fought over street by street. It is said to be tying up 12 of Russias 70-plus battalion tactical groups (battalions usually consist of 800-1,000 troops) in the Donbass. But the shelling of Kharkiv, where 18 people have been killed and 106 injured in the last few days, and of Marinka, Slavyansk and Kramatorsk, as well as the Russian capture of the eastern town of Kreminnaare a clear sign that Russia is unwilling to wait for the port city to fall to press on with its new offensive. Its redeployment from Kyiv appears to be complete.\nFour Russian rockets also smashed into the western city of Lviv, killing seven people and injuring at least 11  a reminder that nowhere is safe.\nThis second phase of the war, in effect a reprise against massively larger invading forces of the deadlocked war that has been fought in Donbass since 2014, will test Ukraine in a completely new way. The tactical flexibility and boldness demonstrated against Russias bogged-down columns north of Kyiv will need to be adapted to the wide rolling plains and entrenched positions of the east.\nThat, as the Ukrainians have made repeatedly clear in appeals to the West, will require new types of weaponry  tanks, planes, air defences, and anti-ship missile systems  that their allies have been initially slow to supply. Divisions within Germanys governing parties centre on whether Berlin should be willing to supply heavy arms, particularly tanks, bilaterally to Ukraine or should only do so through Nato Yesterday US president Joe Bidenconvened a videoconference with G7 EU and Nato leaders to discuss the latest developments and bolster supplies to the beleaguered country.\nThe increasing likelihood that the war will now be prolonged is also challenging to some more accommodating states who fear their own stocks of weapons are already being depleted dangerously by their offerings to Ukraine at a time of increased tension with Russia. And experts warn that speeding up arms production lines and training in new weapons systems both require time, which is in short supply. Ukraine needs more weapons on the ground immediately.\nTopics:",

A leisurely pace, compared to the flight of those who came after, but there were no bombs then.\nUkrainian Refugee Crisis\nWinnipeg Free Press photojournalist Mikaela MacKenzie and writer Melissa Martin in Krakow, Poland.\nPosted: 4:13 PM Apr. 7, 2022\nAs the world watches in horror the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and as Manitobans prepare to open their arms to refugees, the Free Press has sent writer Melissa Martin and photographer Mikaela MacKenzie to Poland to report on the largest refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War.\nRead Full Story\nStill, it was obvious to Pyzh that something bad was about to happen. Russia was massing its troops on the border. Foreign countries were moving diplomats out of Kyiv and U.S. President Joe Biden warned of an imminent invasion. Pyzhs friends werent too worried  \"nothing will start,\" they said  but she was gripped by an urgent and terrible feeling.\n\"Im a really anxious person,\" she says, bluntly. \"In my world, there is nothing so terrifying like war.\"\nMentally, shed given herself another reason to go. Six years earlier, Pyzh, an architect and artist, had held an exhibition of her works at a gallery in Warsaw, a collection of pieces reflecting on what Ukraine had been left with after the Soviet Union collapsed. One of the largest paintings from that show was still in Poland, and she thought she might take it back.\nMIKAELA MACKENZIE / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS\nUkrainian artist Oksana Pyzh at the Maggha Centre in Krakow.\n\"It was like, OK, in case the war wont start, at least we will take my paintings from Warsaw,\" she says. \"That was Plan B.\"\nThe war started. She got the painting. Now, she and her family have found a temporary home in a town just outside Krakw. And thanks to a group of allies with a Winnipeg connection, that painting has become the heart of a new exhibition of contemporary Ukrainian art, one of the first of its kind in Poland during the war.\n\"I think its our work right now to do something that should put attention to this theme (of war), and thats all we can do,\" she says of Ukrainian artists. \"Its now to change the attention of the European Union and all people around the world.\"\nIts a cloudy afternoon in Krakw, grey and cool and drizzled by rain. We are sitting on the sculpted terrace of the Manggha Museum, which usually hosts exhibitions of Japanese culture but is now home to Fight With Art, an assemblage of works by Ukrainian artists, most of whom are still living  and some literally fighting  inside Ukraine.\nPyzhs large canvas forms the centrepiece of the exhibition. Its a map of Ukraine, rendered through dots of paint; inside each dot is a Cyrillic letter drawn from the text of the 1991 Belovezh Accords that dissolved the Soviet Union. But the words are illegible to the viewer: its a map, but not a map. A text, but not a text.\nMIKAELA MACKENZIE / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS\nSince coming to Poland, Oksana Pyzh has acquired some canvases, which she plans to use to create more large works while shes unable to go home to Kharkiv.\n\"You cant read it, the same as you cant read any potential on these political documents,\" she says.\nThe exhibition is the second of at least three such events organized by FestivALT, a Krakw-based Jewish arts and activism collective that has thrown itself into Ukrainian solidarity work since the war started. Since opening on April 4, Fight With Art has garnered a swell of local press in Krakw; visitors have been coming, and theyve been talking.\n\"Theres a lot of momentum,\" says FestivALT co-founder Michael Rubenfeld, who helped launch the show.\nRubenfeld knows, as well as anyone can, how art can be a powerful vehicle to explore identity, disruption and trauma. In a way, thats what brought him to Poland six years ago, returning to the country his grandparents had left after surviving the Holocaust. It was a personal journey and a creative one. And now, it has put him in a perfect position to help.\nThat journey began in Winnipeg. Rubenfeld grew up in Garden City, in what he calls a \"pretty normal Jewish family.\" As a youth, he went to Hebrew school and felt totally disconnected from his familys roots in Europe: everything he heard about Poland was negative, he says, an expression of the collective trauma carried by those who had survived the war.\n\"The kind of education I received was the Bible, the Holocaust and then the formation of Israel until now,\" he says, chatting over coffee at a dim-lit cafe in what was once the Nazi-era Jewish ghetto. \"There was this insane 2,000-year gap that was just not talked about. It was very strange. I just didnt know anything about the contemporary version of my culture.\"\nMIKAELA MACKENZIE / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS\nMichael Rubenfeld at the CentrALT office in Krakow.\nAs a teen, he moved to Toronto, where he became a successful actor and theatre producer. For much of his career, his work didnt explore Jewish identity all that much: \"I really didnt understand why being Jewish mattered,\" he says. \"When I think about my version of Jewish culture, its like, Garden City and I was like, I dont feel like this is who I want to be.\"\nBut after meeting his wife, Magda, in Montreal, his life changed. Shes also Jewish, but originally from Poland; after getting married, they had to \"choose a country,\" Rubenfeld says. The thought of returning to his grandparents homeland intrigued him; he saw an opportunity to restore a connection to a place and a culture that had been severed decades ago.\n\"Seventy per cent of Europes Jews were in Poland, and they were here for a reason,\" he says. \"They liked Poland, they liked living here. And it started to get bad in the 1930s, and of course it was bad in different periods of time the way it was bad for Jews all over the world. But this was the place that Jews wanted to live. We dont think about it that way anymore.\"\nIn Krakw, he and his wife got to work. They co-founded FestivALT, an arts and activism collective dedicated to bringing new vibrancy to contemporary Jewish culture in Poland. Their projects are challenging and sometimes a little cheeky, but always focused on engaging new conversations about identity, antisemitism and the preservation and renewal of memory.\nThey opened a small gallery space in the heart of the former ghetto, where Nazis forced 20,000 Jews into an area with just 320 buildings. Next door to their gallery i",

      "body": "Democratic senator Chris Murphy (Photo| AP)\nBy\nAssociated Press\nBELGRADE: A US Senate delegation on Tuesday urged Serbia to join the rest of Europe and impose sanctions against Russia for its bloody campaign in Ukraine. \"We understand Serbia has a long cultural and economic history with Russia,\" said Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) after the three-member bi-partisan delegation met Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.\n\"But this is a moment where there is great risk if we, as a democratic community, don't send a united message about the consequences of Russia's behavior in Ukraine. And our hope is that we will be able to stand with Serbia in the coming weeks and months to send that clear message to Russia,\" he told reporters.\nAlthough Serbia voted in favor of three United Nations resolutions condemning the Russian aggression against Ukraine, it has not joined international sanctions against Moscow.\nSerbia, which is formally seeking European Union membership, depends almost entirely on Russian energy supplies. Vucic has said that imposing sanctions against traditional Slavic allies in Moscow would be disastrous for Serbia.\n\"I think we made the case that as the president (Vucic) has said, the future of Serbia lies with the rest of Europe, lies in the West, and he has been moving in that direction, (with) trade ties, business investment. And as we pointed out, if that's the intent, then certainly looking at the foreign policy that's currently in place by the EU is very important,\" said Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH).\nThe senators also said that if Serbia really wants to join the EU, it should reconsider on rapidly arming itself with Russian and Chinese weapons. \"In in the long run, I think every country needs to make a decision about whether their security interests are best aligned with China. If Serbia is intent on being a member of the European Union, then it's probably not in their long-term interests to have a security relationship with China,\" Murphy said.\nSerbia's rapid military buildup in the region that was at war in the 1990s has worried its neighbors and raised fears in the West of new possible bloodshed in the Balkans.\nEarlier this month, China delivered a sophisticated air defense system to Belgrade despite earlier US warnings that if Serbia wants to join Western integrations it should align its military with Western standards.\nNow we are on Telegram too.

The official said the Russians added two more battalion tactical groups in the past 24 hours, for a total of 78.

No nations from the Group of Seven (G-7) are boycotting the full G-20 gathering.\nThere are other meetings that Yellen will participate in, including the opening ceremony, which will also include the Ukrainian finance minister as a show of solidarity for Ukraine, the Treasury official told The Hill.\nWhile Secretary Yellen and our partners will continue to work in solidarity to advance the important business of the G20, she will also voice our strong condemnation of Putins brutality and make it clear that the benefits and privileges of the leading economic institutions of the world  which we helped create after WW2  are reserved for countries that demonstrate respect for the core principles that underpin peace and security across the world, the Treasury official added.\nThe Washington Post was the first to reportthe news of Yellens boycott.\nDuring a House briefing earlier this month, Yellen\nwarned the United States wo\nuld not participate in the G-20 meetings if Russia was also there, noting that President Biden had called for Russia to be removed from the G-20.\nSo, President Bidens made it clear, and I certainly agree with him, that it cannot be business as usual in any  for Russia in any of the financial institutions, Yellen said during a House hearing.\nIllinois and Vermont metros overtake New York cities as top COVID hotspots\nHes asked that Russia be removed from the G-20, Yellen said in response to a question at the hearing, adding, And Ive made clear to my colleagues in Indonesia that we will not be participating in a number of meetings if the Russians are there.\nThe Russian invasion in Ukraine, more than 50 days in, has been widely condemned by countries around the world, leading Russian elites, banks, sectors of its economy and imports to be sanctioned internationally.\n Updated at 3:06 p.m.",

Supplied by YouTube; Date Unknown\n[[title]]\nAn error occurred. Please try again.\n[[success]]\nEmail address\nSign up\nA Tayside blogger has been condemned for posting a feature length video of a British prisoner of war who surrendered during fighting in Ukraine.\nGraham Phillips, a former Perth High School pupil, caused outrage following the publication of his interview with captive Briton Aiden Aslin.\nYouTube is also facing criticism for hosting the video, which generates advertising revenue.\nMr Phillips, who studied at the University of Dundee, is filmed interviewing Mr Aslin himself after his surrender to Russians in eastern Ukraine.\nMr Aslin is in handcuffs and is described as a prisoner of war.\nThe interviewer opens the exchanges by asking him to confirm he is not being coerced.\nAt times, Mr Phillips prompts the captive with his answers.\nDeath penalty\nHe also tells the camera the Geneva Conventionson prisoners do not necessarily apply.\nTelling him to state he is a mercenary, he adds the penalty is normally death.\nIts suggested a prisoner exchange would save him from potential execution.\nForeign Office sources told us they are aware of the detention and are in touch with families for support.\nIt is impossible to tell from the video what, if any, of this he believes and what he feels compelled to say, the source told us.\nWhile he says he is not under duress, he is handcuffed throughout the video and acknowledges he has been told he faces the death penalty.\nThe foreign office continues to condemn the exploitation of prisoners of war for political purposes, and calls for anyone detained to be treated humanely.\nYoure a luck guy\nDuring the interview, Mr Phillipsasks him to denounce the Ukrainian army and describe fellow combatants as Nazis.\nHe also tries to correct his pronunciation of the Luhansk region to the Russian version.\nYoure a lucky guy, Mr Phillips says at the start.\nGraham Phillips posted from Ukraine online.\nHe goes on to describe barbarous Ukrainian behaviour.\nMr Aslin, who was in besieged Mariupol explains he was with Marines in the conflict.\nHe came to Ukraine in 2018 after time with Kurds.\nBut then he says he was misled and impressionable.\nGoogle should take this down from YouTube immediately.\n human rights expert Marcus Kolga\nIn the 44-minute interview, he says he just wanted to finish his contract and go home with his Ukrainian wife, who he addresses directly to camera.\nWe approached YouTube for comment and contacted Mr Phillips to respond to criticism.\nWe also asked the UK Government to respond but officials would not comment directly on the incident.\nMarcus Kolga, a human rights expert at a Canadian based international disinformation centre, said it is truly appalling the video is raising revenue on YouTube.\nHuman rights barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC told The Telegraph the interview could breach the Geneva Conventions.\nCoercive interrogation of prisoners of war for propaganda purposes is contrary to the Geneva Conventions, so Google should take this down from YouTube immediately or risk prosecution for aiding and abetting, he said.\nFootage posted on YouTube 26/11/2014 by Graham Phillips from Ukraine.\nWho is Graham Phillips?\nMr Phillips was a civil servant for the UK Government but went on to visit Ukraine.\nHis interest appears to focus after the 2014 revolution when he posted videos from the breakaway regions of the east.\nHe was linked to Kremlin broadcaster RT and was eventually detained by Ukrainian authorities and banned from the country.\nHe continued to visit the eastern region and produced pro-Russian content.\nMr Phillips was also recently photographed in front of luggage bearing a huge Z symbol, a common pro-Russian invasion sign.\nAlready a subscriber?",
