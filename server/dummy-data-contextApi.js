      "description": "Ukraine says the decisive fight for country's east has begun as Russia mounts wave of attacks in the Donbas region. Biden to confer with allies.",

      "body": "Moscow again on Tuesday demanded the surrender of holdout Ukrainian forces in the besieged southern port of Mariupol and bombardment boomed across the countrys east in what Russia and Ukraine are calling a major new phase of the ferocious nearly 8-week-old war. Although Ukraine says Russia has begun its long-expected all-out assault in the east  and Moscows top diplomat confirmed Tuesday the struggle has entered its next stage -- some Western military officials and analysts suggest the current attacks are only a prelude to a larger and potentially far more brutal offensive. President Biden was to confer Tuesday with key allies about the next phase of the war and how the West will respond. Ukrainian authorities, meanwhile, implored civilians to get out of the eastern battle zone by any means possible, but acknowledged that for a third straight day there had been no agreement reached with Russia to set up humanitarian corridors those fleeing the fighting could use for safe passage. The latest Russian ultimatum to the Ukrainian forces in Mariupol came in a statement by the defense ministry in Moscow promising that those who lay down their arms are guaranteed to remain alive. But as happened over the weekend, the surrender deadline came and went without any sign of a Ukrainian pullback from a sprawling steelworks plant where fighters and hundreds of civilians are holed up in a network of tunnels. A Ukrainian commander says Russia has been using bunker-buster bombs to try to dislodge the defenders. Mariupols capture would likely be hailed by Russia as a pivotal triumph in a war that has yielded few of those for Moscow. It would free up more brigades for the eastern fight, as well as enable the creation of a strategically important land corridor between Russian-controlled areas and the annexed Crimean Peninsula. Moscow was initially silent on Monday night when Zelensky declared that the war for Ukraines industrial east, known as the Donbas, had begun. The area is made up of two large regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, parts of which are already controlled by Russia-backed separatists. We will fight, the Ukrainian leader vowed in his nightly video address. We will defend ourselves. Russian appeared to confirm the wider offensives start when Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview broadcast Tuesday that another stage of this operation is beginning. I am sure this will be a very important moment of this entire special operation, Lavrov told Indian television. Russia refers to Europes biggest land war since World War II as a special military operation. Ukraines military said Tuesday that Russias apparent aim was to seize full control of the Donbas. Its general staff said in a statement that overnight and early Tuesday, the occupiers made an attempt to break through our defenses along nearly the entire frontline, a distance of more than 300 miles. All along the battlefront, Russian forces were probing for sensitive spots in Ukraines defense, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said. But speaking on national television, he predicted the offensive would fail because the Russians simply do not have enough strength. Even so, civilian casualties were mounting. Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai said on Ukrainian television that the town of Kreminna came under heavy artillery fire overnight, setting residential buildings ablaze. The Ukrainians retreated in order to regroup, giving Russia control of the town, because it simply makes no sense to stand in one place, to die without prospects for inflicting any real harm on the invaders, he said. In the northeasterncity of Kharkiv, hammered by near-constant bombardment, five people had been killed by shelling in the last 24 hours, the regional governor said Tuesday. For many in the battle zone, theres no clear distinction between a much-heralded new phase of fighting and what has already occurred during the nearly two months since Russia invaded its smaller neighbor. In Avdiivka, less than two miles away from the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, shelling had been a constant backdrop, with many forced to live their lives largely underground. In one school, some 200 people took shelter in the dank confines of the basement level, sleeping on mattresses laid over desks. They shared one bathroom, on the ground level. A month ago, an artillery round smashed the fourth-floor apartment of the head of Avdiivka's utility company, who gave only his first name, Rostislav, for reasons of privacy. His family  a wife and three children, the youngest seven months old -- found safety in the Black Sea city of Odessa. But the shelling stole away a home whose purchase had cost him all he had. Im 37, and I have nothing, he said. Standing in front of the ruined apartment building, he pointed out where the shell had hit, debris now in an organized pile on the side of the street. Nearby were gouges and craters in the sidewalk where other artillery rounds had fallen. Despite Avdiivkas proximity to the front lines of the eight-year war between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces, Rostislav described a community that flourished before the Feb. 24 invasion. There was work, money and happiness, he said. Now, like so many other cities across the Donbas, it was virtually a ghost town. Asked if he planned to leave, he sighed a deep sigh. Not today, he said. Bulos reported from Avdiivka, Ukraine and King from Berlin.",

      "description": "Freddie Freeman homers in his first at-bat against the Atlanta Braves and the Dodgers go on to win, 7-4.",
      "body": "Howdy, Im your host, Houston Mitchell. Lets get right to the news. From Jack Harris: Before first pitch Monday night, Dodgers fans gave their former closer a standing ovation. By the bottom of the first inning, their new first baseman had them in a raucous uproar. On a night the Dodgers and Atlanta Braves renewed their budding rivalry, it was each teams newest star member  and the others former franchise favorite  who commanded the brightest spotlight. Kenley Jansen returned to Chavez Ravine for the first time since signing with the Braves this offseason, receiving a warm reception during a pregame ceremony. Freddie Freeman faced the Braves for the first time since coming to the Dodgers in the spring, hitting a home run in his first-ever at-bat against his old club in the Dodgers eventual 7-4 win. The adrenaline is definitely up today, Jansen said pregame. Emotions are all over the place, echoed Freeman. Those sentiments had been building throughout the afternoon. When Jansen showed up to the ballpark, he had to ask a Braves staffer how to get to the away clubhouse. After 350 saves, three All-Star selections and a World Series championship with the Dodgers, it was his first time being a visitor at Chavez Ravine. [Its] weird, man said Jansen, who signed a one-year, $16 million contract as a free agent with the Braves this offseason. The only thing I knew was being a Dodger.  Freddie Freeman expresses himself with hugs and a homer in first game vs. Braves From Ben Bolch: With three words, another season could be played. With three words, a new ending could be written. With three words, a fan base could rejoice. Im coming back, Jaime Jaquez Jr. said, uttering the three words that could also change the trajectory of a program. The UCLA junior guard made his announcement near the end of a video heralding his return for one more college season Monday, taking his jersey out of his locker and slipping it over his shoulders. With his decision, Jaquez prioritized the letters on the front of that jersey over those on the back, reaffirming his devotion to his school. When I committed here, Jaquez said in the nearly 2-minute video released on Twitter and Instagram, I wanted to get this program back on the national stage, back where it belongs among the nations elite. Im proud of what we accomplished the last three years, but theres some unfinished business. I came to UCLA to win a national championship; shouldnt that be the goal? I want to hang banner No. 12 in Pauley Pavilion. Two adults and two juveniles were injured when shots were fired after an argument at a house party, North Las Vegas police Sgt. Vince Booker said Monday. The Las Vegas Review-Journal, citing unnamed sources, identified the most seriously injured person as Aaliyah Gayles, an 18-year-old basketball star at Spring Valley High in Las Vegas who was a McDonalds All-American. Gayles is originally from the Los Angeles area. She recommitted to USC after originally decommitting because of changes on the Trojans coaching staff. Aaliyah is one of the strongest, most resilient young people I have ever known, USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. I have no doubt she will continue to face this unfathomable situation with courage and resolve. We will continue to support her and her parents in every way that we possibly can. Yordan Alvarez homered twice with four RBIs in his return after missing five games because of COVID-19 health and safety protocols to lead the Houston Astros to an 8-3 win over the Angels in their home opener Monday night. But the Astros lost Jose Altuve in the eighth inning with a strained left hamstring in the eighth inning. He fell to the ground after legging out an infield single. Max Stassi hit a solo homer for the Angels, who were without star Mike Trout. He sat with a bruised left hand after being hit by a pitch Sunday. Angels team trainer Mike Frostad said an MRI on Monday was negative for a fracture and that Trout has a bruise. Frostad added Trouts return to the lineup will depend on pain tolerance. From Jeff Miller: He changed teams and conferences but not languages, Troy Reeders new job still allowing him to speak Staley. Familiarity has been a theme of this offseason rebuild for head coach Brandon Staley and his Chargers defense, the addition of Reeder just the latest move. The linebacker reunited with his former defensive coordinator with the Rams by signing as a free agent last week, Reeder joining the Chargers already comfortable with the verbiage, concepts and techniques of Staleys system. He arrived after the Chargers added two other former Staley defenders: edge rusher Khalil Mack in a trade with Chicago and tackle Sebastian Joseph-Day via free agency from the Rams. Youre kind of looking for some familiarity, Reeder said Monday of shopping for a new team. Theres always a comfort aspect to it. 1897  John J.

On Monday, April 18, 2022, a federal judge in Florida voided the national mask mandate covering airplanes and other public transportation saying it exceeded the authority of U.S. health officials. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) (Ted Warren/AP)\nPlaceholder while article actions load\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla.  A federal judges decision to strike down a national mask mandate was met with cheers on some airplanes but also concern about whether its really time to end one of the most visible vestiges of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nArrowRight\nThe major airlines and many of the busiest airports rushed to drop their requirements on Monday after the Transportation Security Administration announced it wouldnt enforce a January 2021 security directive that applied to airplanes, airports, taxis and other mass transit.\nBut the ruling still gave those entities the option to keep their mask rules in place, resulting in directives that could vary from city to city.\nPassengers on an United Airlines flight from Houston to New York, for instance, could ditch their masks at their departing airport and on the plane, but have to put them back on once they land at Kennedy Airport or take a subway.\nAdvertisement\nIn a 59-page lawsuit ruling, U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle in Tampa said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention overstepped its authority in issuing the original health order on which the TSA directive was based. She also said the order was fatally flawed because the CDC didnt follow proper rulemaking procedures.\nMizelle, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, said the only remedy was to throw out the mandate for the entire country because it would be impossible to end it only for the people who objected in the lawsuit.\nThe White House said the mask order is not in effect at this time and called the court decision disappointing.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on whether it would seek an emergency stay to block the judges order. The CDC also declined to comment.\nAdvertisement\nUnited Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines all quickly announced they were yanking the mask requirement for domestic and some international flights. So did American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways.\nSleepy passengers on a Delta flight between Atlanta and Barcelona, Spain, cheered, whistled and applauded when a flight attendant announced the news mid-flight over the ocean.\nNo ones any happier than we are, the attendant says in a video posted by Dillon Thomas, a CBS Denver reporter, who was on the flight. She added that people who wanted to keep on their masks were encouraged to do so.\nBut were ready to give m up, she added. So thank you and happy unmasking day!\nMajor airports dropped their requirements but sided with the CDC in recommending that people be voluntarily masked. They included Los Angeles International Airport, the worlds fifth-busiest by passenger volume, and Salt Lake City International Airport, which announced it would hand out masks to anyone requesting them.\nAdvertisement\nNew York Citys public transit system planned to keep its mask requirement in place. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority said it would make masks optional for riders on its buses and trains.\nThe websites of ride sharing companies Lyft and Uber as of Monday evening still said masks were required.\nThe CDC had recently extended the mask mandate, which was set to expire Monday, until May 3 to allow more time to study the BA.2 omicron subvariant of the coronavirus now responsible for the vast majority of cases in the U.S. But the court ruling puts that decision on hold.\nSince the pandemic began two years ago, many state or local governments had issued various orders requiring masks to be worn inside schools, restaurants, stores or elsewhere. The rules were largely rolled back as the deadliest, most infectious months of the pandemic eased.\nAdvertisement\nBut the national rule for travelers remained and was arguably the most widespread, visible and irksome measure of its kind.\nThe wearing of masks aboard airplanes sparked online flame throwing between those who felt they were crucial to protecting people and those who saw it as an unnecessary inconvenience or even government overkill.\nSome flight attendants found themselves cursed and even attacked by passengers who refused to comply.\nThe lawsuit was filed in July 2021 by two plaintiffs and the Health Freedom Defense Fund, described in the judges order as a nonprofit group that opposes laws and regulations that force individuals to submit to the administration of medical products, procedures and devices against their will.\nRepublicans in Congress waged a running battle to kill the mandate.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was not directly involved in the case but has battled against many government coronavirus requirements, praised the ruling.\nBoth airline employees and passengers deserve to have this misery end, DeSantis tweeted.\n___\nAssociated Press writers David Koenig in Dallas, Michael Balsamo and Will Weissert in Washington, and Karen Matthews in New York contributed to this story.\nComment",

      "description": "He was a swaggering graffiti artist, record executive and radio host who helped shape four decades of New York hip-hop.",
      "body": "ArrowRight\nHis family confirmed the death in a statement released by the New York radio station Hot 97, where he hosted a weekly hip-hop show, The Drama Hour. Additional details were not immediately available, but he had reportedly been hospitalized for four months with covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\nAs a teenager in Harlem, Kay Slay  born Keith Grayson  turned subway cars into his canvas, using as many as 40 spray-paint cans a night to execute elaborate, multicolored pieces on the 1 and 3 lines that rumbled through the city. Creating a graffiti piece was like telling the world something: I am somebody, Im an artist, he said in an interview for Style Wars, an acclaimed 1983 documentary that aired on PBS. But they dont recognize it as art. A lot of people recognize it as vandalism, and its not.\nAdvertisement\nBy the early 2000s, he had traded his spray paint for turntables, creating mix tapes that were sold at specialty stores and on street corners, helping listeners keep tabs on the latest hits and up-and-coming artists. The tapes also served as a platform for established rappers to experiment  and, increasingly, to take on their rivals in diss tracks like Ether, a 2001 song in which Nas went on the attack against Jay-Z.\nThe track first appeared on a mix tape by Kay Slay, helping to secure his reputation as a DJ who championed and even encouraged feuds, sometimes including a diss track and a rejoinder back-to-back on his mixes. Hes like the Jerry Springer of rap, said DJ Goldfinger, the host of a weekly hip-hop party in Manhattan, in a 2003 interview with the New York Times. All the fights happen on his show.\nAfter the East Coast-West Coast rap rivalry culminated in the killings of the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur, diss songs had receded somewhat from mainstream hip-hop. But Kay Slay was credited with helping to bring them back to the fore, and became a favorite of rappers in part because of his willingness to embrace a diss song, no matter how ruthless. Cats know its no holds barred with me, he told the Times. They know that Im not going to edit anything. Its going out the way you gave it to me.\nAdvertisement\nHis tapes served as a venue for diss songs exchanged between 50 Cent and Ja Rule, as well as between Ja Rule and Eminem. They also helped launch his own career as a recording artist: In 2003, he made his major-label debut with The Streetsweeper Vol. 1, which featured guests including 50 Cent, Mobb Deep, Nas and Eminem. The album peaked at No. 4 on Billboards rap and R&B chart, and a follow-up in the Streetsweeper series also reached the Top 10 the next year.\nThe game was boring until I came around, he said shortly before making his major-label debut. Everybody was too busy being fake, acting like they got along and talking about each other behind their backs. I brought the controversy back. I brought the game back to life.\nBorn in New York City on Aug. 14, 1966, Kay Slay grew up living with his grandparents at a public housing project in Harlem. His father was an R&B DJ in Manhattan, and his parents separated by the time he was 5, according to a Vibe magazine profile.\nAdvertisement\nBy age 12, he had started doing graffiti, later adopting the tag Dez because he liked the shape of the letters and the brevity of the name. I wanted a nice small name that I could get up everywhere, and do it quick without getting grabbed, he said in the Style Wars interview. When he was caught the first time, the cop scribbled on my face with a marker and had him call his parents.\nAs he rose to prominence through graffiti, he also got caught up in the negative side of life, as he put it, committing small-time robberies and developing addictions to PCP and cocaine. He was arrested in 1989 on charges of drug possession with intent to sell and spent a year in jail, according to the Times.\nUpon his release, he sought drug counseling and became sober, landing a job at a support center in the Bronx for people with HIV and AIDS. He later worked as a security guard and office assistant and made extra money selling T-shirts, jeans and socks from a shopping cart, using the proceeds to buy music equipment and stage a comeback in hip-hop. Beginning in 1994, he started releasing mix tapes, sometimes putting out one or two a month.\nAdvertisement\nWith the success of his Streetsweeper series, he started working as a record executive, heading A&R for basketball star Shaquille ONeals label Deja 34. He later became a mentor to rappers including Papoose, helping them land record deals while also running a hip-hop magazine, Straight Stuntin', and continuing to release his own music, collaborating with artists including Lil Wayne, Queen Latifah and Kendrick Lamar.\nMany of his albums referenced his tumultuous early years, he noted in a 2003 interview with Spin magazine. Every record plays like a part of my life, he said. This is the life I live  this is how I came up. So if you see me acting a certain way, dont judge me  you aint walk in my shoes.\nGiftOutline",

A food safety website has separately documented thousands of similar complaints dating back to at least 2021.\nThe FDA takes seriously any reports of possible adulteration of a food that may also cause illnesses or injury, FDA told The Post in an emailed statement, noting that isolated incidents and complaints of a less serious nature are monitored and may be used during a future inspection of a company to help the FDA identify problem areas in a production plant.\nAdvertisement:\nWe now have reports of over 3,000 sick citing Lucky Charms, from every state in the US.\nIwaspoisoned.com\n, a real-time consumer reporting platform for food safety issues, meanwhile, shows that Lucky Charms complaints have been trending since late 2021. But theyve surged in recent weeks, with reports surpassing 3,000. Complaints have come from every U.S. state and Canada.\nFood safety is our top priority. We take the consumer concerns reported via a third-party website very seriously. Through our continuing internal investigations, we have not found any evidence of consumer illness linked to the consumption of Lucky Charms, Andrea Williamson, General Mills spokesperson, told The Post in an email. We encourage consumers to please share any concerns directly with General Mills to ensure they can be appropriately addressed.\nThe Minneapolis-based maker of Cheerios, Pillsbury, Yoplait and other top food brands reported net sales of more than $18 billion in 2021 and has a market cap of nearly $42.7 billion.\nThe stream of reports on iwaspoisoned.com is remarkably consistent, with consumers from coast to coast complaining of severe stomach issues. Many reports came from worried parents and grandparents.\nMy daughter became very sick. 102.7 temp, vomiting, stomach pain and chills. She isnt able to keep sips of water down. I asked her about everything she had eaten and drank in the past 24 hours and couldnt figure it out until I saw the news report, one consumer from Grand Forks, N.D., posted over the weekend.\nAdvertisement:\nNausea, vomiting, diarrhea and horrible belching with an awful taste, almost chemical. Household of 4 all experienced the same thing, a consumer from Defiance, Ohio, reported.\nI bought Lucky charms for my son and grandson. They both had nausea and stomach pains. We all ate the same except the Lucky Charms. They ate it several days in a row as a afternoon snack and would get these symptoms, another consumer from Blairsville, Ga., said. No more Lucky Charms and they are both ok now.\nBe civil.  Be kind.",

      "body": "Copied!\nPrint\nKateryna, a 22-year-old Ukrainian, experienced first-hand how quickly the U.S. government can change the way it processes people who are fleeing for their lives when there is the political will to do so.\nShe was in Mexico performing with Nikolas Constantine, her boyfriend and ballroom dance partner, when Russia invaded her country. The couple realized that Kateryna could not return to Ukraine. Constantine is a U.S. citizen, so they decided to head for his home in the Los Angeles area.\nThis story is for subscribers\nWe offer subscribers exclusive access to our best journalism.\nThank you for your support.\nBut when the pair, along with Constantines mother, on March 3 tried to cross north in a car from Tijuana at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry to present Kateryna to U.S. officers and request asylum for her, Customs and Border Protection took her into custody. They threatened to charge Constantine and his mother with smuggling. Eventually, Kateryna was sent to a detention facility across the country, in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nAdvertisement\nYou dont know whats going to happen next, Kateryna recalled of the experience. Its just horrible.\nShe asked not have her full name published because her family is still in Ukraine.\nHow Kateryna and other Ukrainians who arrived in the first weeks of the war were treated stands in stark contrast with how asylum-seekers are being received now.\nFor Subscribers\nUkrainians only: Racial disparities in U.S. border policies grow more obvious\nU.S. border officials use Title 42, a pandemic border policy, in ways that allow some to seek asylum while keeping others out.\nWhat happened to the earlier arrivals illustrates how the system usually functions if someone is able to reach U.S. soil and request asylum without being expelled. Once federal officials decided to treat Ukrainians differently from other migrants fleeing potentially deadly situations in their home countries, the entry process for them became quick, with no time in custody before being released into the United States to reunite with loved ones.\nNeither CBP nor ICE responded to requests for comment about what happened to Kateryna.\nAdvertisement\nWeeks detained\nAfter Kateryna was taken into custody at the border, CBP put her in a little room at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry and questioned her, she recalled.\nMeanwhile, Constantine said, he and his mother were held in what he referred to as a cage for what felt like hours. He isnt sure how much time passed, he said, because their phones were taken from them while CBP searched his mothers car.\nAll these women cops were coming up to us and saying we just committed a felony, were going to prison: This is going to be a permanent record. You guys are in so much trouble. Were towing your car away,  Constantine recalled. Finally, out of nowhere, like three hours later, two cops came over and gave us our passports and said we were free to go.\nIts like they can make their own rules, Constantine added. When you dont have a phone and arent able to speak to your lawyer, they have full range of power over you.\nCBP placed Kateryna in five-point shackles  connecting her wrists, ankles and waist  and sent her to the San Ysidro Port of Entry, she said. There, she was kept in a basement holding cell for weeks and permitted to call Constantine only after more than a week in custody. She said she was never allowed to contact her attorney.\nAlong with roughly 24 other people  mostly Ukrainian and Russian  she had to sleep on the floor of the cell, Kateryna recalled. She was given a thin, metallic blanket that did not keep her warm in the notoriously cold cell. Spanish-speaking asylum seekers have long called such cells\nhielera\n(ice chest).\nKateryna, of Ukraine, and boyfriend Nikolas Constantine described her ordeal trying to request protection in the U.S., which included a brief stay in a Louisiana immigration detention center. You dont know whats going to happen next, she said.\n(Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times)\nIt was so cold there that after the second day, people started getting sick, Kateryna said through a friend, who translated from Russian. Everybody was asking them to at least turn off the air conditioner, and their response was, We cannot turn it off, because we keep it cold to kill the bacteria in the air. \nThe food portions were small, she said. She recalled one Ukrainian woman in her 60s who had a heart condition but wasnt given her medication while in custody.\nConstantine and his mother frantically tried to find out where Kateryna was and what would happen to her. His mother reached out to her congresswoman, Julia Brownley (D-Westlake Village) and to the San Diego Union-Tribune. A reporter began sending inquiries to CBP about the case.\nIve never seen him so distraught in his life,  friend Matteo Laudati said of Constantine.\nAdvertisement\nAfter two weeks in the port of entry holding cell, Kateryna was transferred  handcuffed on a several-hour flight  to a long-term detention facility in Louisiana in the custody of ICE. She met dozens of other Ukrainian and Russian women there.\nShe tried to mentally prepare herself to stay in the facility for months, but after arriving at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center, she was released the next day. Constantine and his mother say it was because of Brownleys efforts that Kateryna wasnt held longer.\nBrownleys office confirmed that the congresswoman had quickly reached out to the White House about the case.\nAs a democracy under siege, Ukraine and the Ukrainian people deserve our utmost support and aid  that includes helping Ukrainians fleeing their war-torn country settle in the United States, Brownley said in a statement.\nNo officer assigned\nRelatives of other early arrivals described a torturous process while they waited to hear from Ukrainians who had been taken into custody.\nMaksym Armash spent a week waiting to find out what happened to his fiancee when she crossed the border to San Diego.\n(Maksym Armash )\nMaksym Armash, 22, spent a week waiting to find out what happened to his fiancee when she crossed the border to San Diego.\nArmash, who lives in Virginia, is originally from Ukraine but has had a green card for years. He and his fiancee had an appointment scheduled for April with the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine to get her a visa to join him in the United States, but that was canceled after Russia invaded.\nAs the couple tried to figure out how to keep her safe, she suggested trying to get to Armash and the United States through Mexico and requesting asylum.\nOn her fourth try, the fiancee and two other Ukrainian asylum-seekers managed to drive in the San Ysidro car lanes onto U.S. soil, where they were taken into CBP custody.\nAdvertisement\nFor Subscribers\nCBP staffs up San Diego border line as Russians, others try to drive across to reach asylum in U.S.\nPorts of entry are still not processing asylum seekers who arrive on foot, so some have resorted to driving onto U.S.",

      "body": "ArrowRight\nThe ruling gives airports, mass transit systems, airlines and ride-hailing services the option to keep mask rules or ditch them entirely, resulting in rules that vary by city and mode of transportation.\nPassengers on an United Airlines flight from Houston to Kennedy Airport, for instance, could ditch their masks at their departing airport and on the plane, but have to put them back on once they land in New York or take a subway.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had recently  extended the mandate until May 3 to allow more time to study the BA.2 omicron subvariant of the coronavirus now responsible for the vast majority of U.S. cases. But the court decision put the mandate on hold.\nAdvertisement\nHeres a look at how U.S. transportation centers and providers are responding:\nAIRLINES\nMajor airlines were some of the first to update their rules after the court decision. United, Southwest, American, Alaska, Delta and JetBlue announced that, effective immediately, masks would no longer be required on domestic flights.\nWhile this means that our employees are no longer required to wear a mask  and no longer have to enforce a mask requirement for most of the flying public  they will be able to wear masks if they choose to do so, as the CDC continues to strongly recommend wearing a mask on public transit, United Airlines said.\nThe Association of Flight Attendants, the nations largest union of cabin crews, has recently taken a neutral position on the mask rule because its members are divided about the issue. On Monday, the unions president appealed for calm on planes and in airports.\nAdvertisement\nAlaska Airlines said some passengers who were banned for violating the mask policy will remain banned.\nAIRPORTS\nAirports werent as fast to do away with masks, with several expressing uncertainty about the ruling and taking a wait-and-see approach.\nBut others, including the two main airports in Houston, did away with mask requirements soon after the Transportation Security Administration said it would no longer enforce the mask mandate. Los Angeles International and Phoenix Sky Harbor also eliminated their mask requirements. San Francisco International Airport said it was waiting for further guidance from TSA.\nThe New York City airports appeared to keep the mandate intact.\nTRAINS AND BUSES\nThe rules for train and bus passengers vary by city and transit agency.\nIn New York, Metropolitan Transportation Authority communications director Tim Minton said the system was keeping the mask mandate, meaning face coverings are still required on the subway, buses and commuter rail lines, as they have since early in the pandemic.\nAdvertisement\nBut the regional train system serving the Washington, D.C., area said Monday that masks will be now optional for its customers and employees going forward.\nOur mask mandate has been based on federal guidance, said Paul J. Wiedefeld, general manager and CEO of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. We will continue to monitor this situation as it unfolds, but masks will be optional on Metro property until further notice.\nAmtrak also said it was making masks optional.\n___\nRIDE SHARING\nThe websites of ride sharing companies Lyft and Uber as of Monday evening still said masks were required.\nComment",

      "body": "ArrowRight\nSince Monday was tax day, Democrats naturally focused on the tax hike aspect of his plan. The White House put out a statement, declaring, The President is fighting for tax cuts for the middle class and to ensure that the super wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share, while congressional Republicans, led by Senator Scott, are proposing big tax increases on middle-class families. The White House stressed that one study found Scotts plan would raise taxes on around 75 million American families  96 percent of them making less than $100,000, who would pay an average of $1,480 more in taxes each year.\nFollow\nFollow\nAdd\nThe White House also noted that the plan doesnt raise a single penny in taxes from the wealthiest Americans or profitable corporations. It might have added that the GOP doesnt want to increase funding for the Internal Revenue Service so it that can go after rich tax cheats. By contrast, President Bidens budget request would add a new tax on billionaires, raise taxes on big corporations and those making more than $400,000 while maintaining cuts such as the child tax credit first enacted in the American Rescue Plan.\nAdvertisement\nBiden was not the only Democrat highlighting Scotts tax-the-not-rich plan. Democrats such as Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), who is in a tough reelection race, tweeted: congressional Republicans are running on a platform in 2022 that calls for increasing taxes on middle class Americans while letting all federal laws, including Social Security, expire every 5 years.\nDemocrats will need to pound away at the radical agenda if they are to hold back the Republicans midterm onslaught. But pointing to a tax plan none of them actually have voted for, and some will renounce, will not be sufficient. Democrats would be smart to make a larger argument against a party masquerading as populist but aimed to protect themselves and their wealthy donors.\nDemocrats might want to remind voters that Republicans opposed raising any taxes on corporations, even on those that pay zero dollars in federal taxes; passing a $35 cap on insulin and a plan to allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drugs prices; funding to allow schools to reopen quickly and safely; and shoring up state financing to keep cops, firefighters and other state and local personnel on the payroll. Plus, most Republicans  including\nmembers and 30 senators  opposed the hugely popular infrastructure package. In short, they are willing to help the super-rich and big corporations but virtually no one else.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, Democrats may want to point out that Republicans want to insulate themselves from accountability (e.g., they opposed an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection and favor measures to make voting harder). Republicans also prefer to waste time on extreme schemes to solve fake issues instead of focusing on real problems. Wheres their inflation plan? Their energy plan? Their crime plan? Their education plan? Instead, theyre passing legislation to allow concealed gun possession without a license, harassing businesses and families, attempting to ban math books, and\nexcising\ncivil rights history from the classroom.\nSo while Democrats are sorely in need of an overarching message, the good news is they have one: Republicans cater to the rich and the radicals. Democrats are for making your life easier. And it has the benefit of being true.\nComment",

      "description": "After Reconstruction, state legislatures manipulated more than 1,300 county borders. That helped Southern white supremacists suppress and erase the Black vote, my research finds.",
      "body": "ArrowRight\nCounties oversee the administration of presidential elections, and elect their own important officials such as sheriffs, school superintendents and election administrators. That makes them critical units of political organization. As The Washington Post reported, critics of the push to divide Maricopa County see this as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of elections, which are administered at the county level. The new counties, Republicans must calculate, will either vote for Republicans legitimately, or be more likely to be run by election officials who will support attempts to paint future elections as fraudulent.\nIn my research\n, Ive analyzed the history of county division during the Jim Crow era. There Ive found that newly created counties, like those proposed in Arizona, were more likely to administer fraudulent elections. I also find that these new counties hurt Black voters and Black officeholders the most.\nAdvertisement\nHow I did my research\nFrom 1865 to 1920, the period from the Civil War through the early 20th century, state legislatures created more than 300 counties and significantly adjusted the borders of 1,000 existing ones. This geographic manipulation happened during the same period that the federal government ceased enforcing Reconstruction, enabling the former Confederate states to abandon democratic elections and voting rights for African Americans. During this time, new counties were created to target Black voters and officeholders, helping the then-white-supremacist-aligned Democratic Party solidify control over the South and institute Jim Crow rule.\nI used the Newberry Librarys online atlas of historical county boundaries, which has data on the historical boundaries of every county in the United States, to detect changes to county boundaries and track the emergence of new counties from 1865 through 1920. Of the roughly 1,500 total counties that existed as this period ends, about 300 were established in the South during the Jim Crow era. Then, using historical election and demographic data, I compared new counties created in the South and counties targeted for manipulation with other counties in the South to see whether they had been targeted for political or racial reasons. By comparing the demographics, turnout, and partisanship of newly created counties and the counties from which their land was taken, I can determine whether the geographic changes were made with racial and political factors in mind. I also looked at whether these changes benefited the party that controlled that states legislature.\nThe party of Jim Crow changed county lines to disadvantage Black voters\nAdvertisement\nOver the years leading up to and during Jim Crow in the South, I find that Democratic state legislatures disproportionately ``packed Black voters into new counties, thus reducing their voting power statewide by concentrating their electoral influence in fewer political units.\nNew counties had a much higher proportion of Black residents than the counties that were divided or adjusted to allow the new county to be created. While most counties in the South had only small concentrations of Black residents, making up from zero to roughly 20 percent, most new counties had between 20 and 75 percent Black residents  leaving the old counties disproportionately White.\nPutting all of a minority group into a single county or district, which scholars of congressional gerrymandering call packing, served several purposes  just as it would in Arizona today. First, the new counties that are more likely to vote in line with the political goals of the state legislature  Democrats in the Jim Crow South, Republicans in contemporary Arizona  would elect more like-minded political officers and would certify election results favorable to the state legislature. Second, the new counties packed with non-White residents can be policed in ways that discourage voting or have the results manipulated for fraudulent outcomes.\nNew counties were a hotbed of election fraud\nAdvertisement\nAs expected, when I examined the new counties created in the Jim Crow South, I found that the new counties voted in larger proportions for Democrats than you would expect based on their residents past voting behavior. Given the high Black population of the new counties, my analysis predicted that Democrats would win only a low proportion of the vote, from zero to 50 percent. Not only do Republican-supporting regions report huge support for Democrats (60 to 100 percent) after being moved into new counties, but they also do so at rates unlikely to be produced by legitimate elections.\nNevertheless, new counties voted almost entirely for Democrats. While having one party win 100 percent of the vote in a county is an obvious sign of fraud, so is winning just under 100 percent, pointing to a lack of legitimate political competition. That these results occurred in locations disproportionately inhabited by Black Americans and Republican voters signals that the counties were changed to make it easier to suppress Black voting and otherwise conduct severe political manipulation and fraud.\nOver this half-century, Democratic state legislatures in the South oversaw hundreds of these county changes. Of the new counties drawn by Democratically controlled state legislatures, only about 8 percent saw a Republican win an election in the next electoral cycle. Further, when Black officeholders were moved into new counties, they lost their offices at a faster rate than Black officeholders who were not targeted by geographic manipulation.\nAdvertisement\nBreaking up Maricopa County uses the Jim Crow playbook\nThe plan to divide Maricopa County is an old trick in the playbook of American anti-democratic movements. While the number of new counties created by state legislatures plummeted in the late 20th century, states still have the power to redraw their internal borders. As national political figures pressure states to provide illegitimate election returns, more and more state legislatures may consider creating new counties.",

      "description": "Russian central bank chief Elvira Nabiullina has cultivated the image of a nerdy, opera-loving technocrat, trapped in place by Putin's decision to go to war in Ukraine. It's not that simple.",
      "body": "AFP/AFP via Getty Images\nAFP/AFP via Getty Images\nA few weeks ago, I edited an edition of this newsletter that introduced you to Elvira Nabiullina, the head of Russia's central bank. During her tenure as Russia's top banker, Nabiullina has managed to charm the West  or its bankers, at least  and cultivated the image of a firmly professional technocrat who likes opera and has been blindsided by the war in Ukraine.\nNabiullina also appears to have bewitched much of the press, who love the idea that every time she appears in public she could be signaling her unspoken thoughts about the economy ... via her clothing choices. As we reported in our newsletter, on her first public appearance after the invasion of Ukraine, she wore all black, a choice that was interpreted by many as a gesture of mourning (For Russia? For Ukraine? For integrity in central banking?) And, like the late Madeleine Albright, Nabiullina likes to wear brooches that telegraph her opinions about the state of the economy. In other words, Nabiullina is one of the very few Russian officials to have retained the respect, if not admiration, of the West.\nBut who is the real Elvira Nabiullina?\nA Putin Protege\nNabiullina graduated from Moscow State University in 1986. Over the next twelve years, she worked her way up through the USSR Science and Industry Union and its successor, the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and then through the ministry for economic development and trade. She worked for a bank for a couple of years, and then it was back to the ministry in 2000 as first deputy, after Vladimir Putin became prime minister the previous year.\nFrom then on, Nabiullina would remain close to Putin. When he became president, later in 2000, Putin appointed Nabiullina minister of economic development and trade. When he was elected president for a third term, in 2012, he brought her into the Kremlin, and made her his advisor on economic affairs. The next year, Putin made her governor of the central bank of Russia. He nominated her to a third term as governor on March 18 of this year.\nNabiullina impressed the global banking community right out of the gate. Bankers feted her for taking a strong position on the Russian banking sector between 2013 and 2017, when she withdrew more than 300 banking licenses from institutions that were either chronically weak or unscrupulously led   amounting to one-third of Russia's credit institutions. They lauded her for taking a robust position on inflation, cutting the base rate to a record low of 2.18 percent in February of 2018. And they praised her for allowing the ruble to float in 2014, rather than controlling the exchange rate, which the CBR had done in the past.\nWindow Dressing\nThe accolades flooded in. In 2015, Euromoney magazine named Nabiullina Central Bank Governor of the Year. In 2017, The Banker named her Central Banker of the Year, Europe. The following year, the International Monetary Fund invited her to give its prestigious annual Michel Camdessus lecture.\nBut critics have pointed out that a lot of her achievements are merely camouflage for the Putin regime. The banks she closed down between 2013 and 2017 were consolidated by other institutions, three of which  Bank Otkritie, B&N Bank & Promsvyazbank   later failed, had to be bailed out, and ended up costing the CBR two trillion rubles.  Those three banks were owned by Kremlin-connected oligarchs Igor Finogenov, Mikhail Gutseriev, and the brothers Dmitry and Alexei Ananyev, respectively. Observers at the time accused the banks of mismanagement and even corruption: at the time of the bailouts, the CBR said later, Bank Otkrytie's capital was largely fictitious.\nThe Indicator from Planet Money recently spoke with Maximilian Hess, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in London and a long-time Russia watcher. He says the signs that Nabiullina is a complicit member of Putin's inner circle were there for all to see from the moment she took on the role of governor of the CBR. A year into the role, she had to field an appeal from Russian oil flagship Rosneft. Russia had just invaded Crimea and the West had imposed sanctions on a raft of companies, including Rosneft. The company found itself squeezed by sanctions and falling prices on one side, and a combined $21 billion in upcoming debt payments on the other. It needed help.\nNabiullina was there. She engineered Rosneft's issue of 625 billion rubles ($10.2 billion) in local debt, which Hess says were pushed into the market without any kind of notice. She then added those notes to the CBR's Lombard credit list of securities that can be used as collateral for hard currency. Next, she made billions of dollars in loans to Rosneft, using the company's own notes as collateral.\nIt was a neat financial magic trick that amounted to a $15 billion bailout of the oil giant. It also hammered the ruble, which fell 20 percent against the dollar. Nabiullina tried to save the day by pumping interest rates up to 17 percent from 10.5 percent, but to no avail.\n\"So effectively what Nabiullina did was to bail out perhaps the most Kremlin-connected company.\" Hess says. \"She not only destroyed Russian savings, but she made the cost of investment for them a lot higher. The Russian central bank says it has a mandate of protecting the economy and keeping price stability in check as with most central banks, but really Nabiullina only has one mandate and that is to protect the Kremlin and the Kremlin regime.\"\nHess says that nothing has changed since then. Nabiullina remains a key member of Putin's inner circle, despite rumors that she asked to resign in March, after the invasion of Ukraine. Other critics go further, saying she assisted in the plan for the invasion of Ukraine by building up Russia's foreign currency reserves on the one hand, while squeezing the Russian people with austerity measures on the other. Some even compare her to Albert Speer, Hitler's minister of armaments and war production, who was jailed for war crimes.\nIt's hard to know exactly who Elvira Nabiullina is, and what motivates her. She does, after all, work in the Kremlin, which is hardly a bastion of transparency. She started her career as a supposedly liberal technocrat, but her proximity to Vladimir Putin over the years appears to have eroded her willingness to remain politically aloof. It may be that Putin's decision to invade Ukraine was too much for her to stomach, and that she did attempt to resign, but the fact is that she is still in place, doing Putin's bidding, as she has for the last 22 years. Bankers and journalists in the West may hope that, in her heart, Nabiullina is still something of a liberal, committed to the principles of sound, non-partisan macroeconomics. It would be a mistake, however, to expect her to behave that way.",

(AP Photo/Joe Buglewicz)\nPlaceholder while article actions load\nLAS VEGAS  Nathan Bastian had a goal and an assist, and the New Jersey Devils beat the Vegas Golden Knights 3-2 on Monday night.\nThe Golden Knights blew their chance to gain ground on the Los Angeles Kings in the Pacific Division, and their playoff hopes lessened severely with just five games left to play. Vegas is three points back of Los Angeles in the division and four points back of Dallas and Nashville for a wild-card berth.\nArrowRight\nIn a rare win for the Devils  their 13th in their last 40 games  Andreas Johnsson and Jesper Boqvist also scored, while Andrew Hammond made 42 saves. It was Hammonds first win as a Devil; hes playing with his third organization this season and made just his eighth NHL appearance of the season.\nKeegan Kolesar and Chandler Stephenson scored for Vegas and Robin Lehner stopped 25 shots.\nAdvertisement\nTaking advantage of a Vegas turnover in its own zone, Devils center Michael McLeod fired a slap shot that Lehner stopped, but Bastian skated by at the right time to tap home the rebound and give New Jersey an early lead in the opening period.\nThe Golden Knights got the equalizer late in the second period from the unlikeliest of candidates, as Kolesar skated down the right side and sent the puck across the slot, then off New Jersey defenseman P.K. Subbans skate and past Hammond.\nVegas offensive flame was quickly extinguished early in the third, when Johnsson grabbed a rebound on the right side of the goal and sent it top shelf over Lehners glove to put New Jersey back in front by a goal.\nBoqvist essentially sealed things midway through the third, when he drove in and around Alex Pietrangelo and slid the puck into the net. It appeared Lehner never even saw the attempt, as he watched Boqvist skate into the corner for at least two seconds before realizing the puck was in the net.\nWith Lehner pulled for a man advantage, Stephenson made it a one-goal game with 1:14 left in the game, but Vegas couldnt tie it.\nUP NEXT\nNew Jersey: Hosts Buffalo on Thursday.\nVegas: Hosts Washington on Wednesday.\n__\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\nComment",

You arent doing this to yourself on purpose  and you dont stay angry at people who do things to you that are clearly by accident, do you?\nPresumably your question is, How do I fix this?\nI'll give you the start of an answer, by advising you to find a career coach or useful friend who can give you some mock interviews. Practice makes calm. Consider talking to your doctor about your anxiety, too, to see if treatment makes sense.\nAdvertisement\nThe rest is collective wisdom from readers:\n Ive hired several people who gave lousy interviews, when they were exceptionally strong candidates. Note that lousy here doesnt mean hostile, clueless, or clearly lying about their qualifications  just nervous. Bonus points for a self-aware introduction like, I know I dont give the strongest interviews, but Im a very strong employee who could help your organization by [specifics]. An interview should only be one part of the equation.\n My approach is to always be applying for new jobs, with the goal of having about one interview a quarter, so Im not out of practice when it matters. I tell my supervisors Im doing this so they dont freak out when they find out.\n My local community college has a whole department for helping their students and community members. You can do practice interviews, get help with your rsum, network, do aptitude testing.\nAdvertisement\n Reach out to the bombed interviewer: That didnt go as well as I would have hoped. Would like to clear up my reply on the question of X/Y. Thanks for your time, its a very interesting position and Id  appreciate being able to flex my skills in Z.\n Im terrible at interviews. In the most recent one they asked the typical, Anything else you want us to know? And I just said it: Im bad at interviews. But, Im really good at my job. I got that job.\n Interviews were pure agony, until the time I realized I didnt want to work for the person interviewing me. He was not pleasant. I felt a shift in the balance of power and I relaxed. Now I have internalized that I am interviewing the employer as much as they are interviewing me.\n Alison Green has really good tips on interviews and applying for jobs.\nAdvertisement\n I wear black to avoid having to be concerned about visible sweat stains.\n I take charge and ask a lot of questions instead of sitting there and trying not to say something dumb.\n Next time you get nervous (or self loathy), remember my college professor. He had the same issue  terrible sweating in job interviews. He was bald, so he would bring a handkerchief with him to dab his head. One time he wiped his whole dome and after a while realized he wasnt sweating. He walked out thinking he nailed the interview and things were changing  turns out he grabbed the handkerchief he had recently used to wax his bowling ball. No sweating, but a very shiny interview.",

      "description": "Vice President Kamala Harris says the U.S. will halt tests of anti-satellite missiles. The move follows a Russian test in November that blew up a satellite and polluted low-Earth orbit with more than 1,000 pieces of debris.",
      "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris kicked off a weeklong trip home to California on Monday with a stop at Vandenberg Space Force Base, where she said the U.S. would halt testing of satellite-killing missiles to reduce the threat posed by space debris. The self-imposed ban comes amid rising tensions with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine and Moscow's decision in November to test a missile that blew up one of its own satellites. That explosion polluted low-Earth orbit with more than 1,500 pieces of dangerous debris, forcing the crew of the International Space Station to take shelter. Even a tiny bit of such space junk could damage or destroy a satellite, space station or spacecraft. The U.S. and its allies have sharply criticized the Kremlin over the test, with Harris in December calling it \"an irresponsible act.\" China used a missile in 2007 to destroy one of its satellites, a blast that continues to litter space with nearly 3,000 pieces of debris. \"These tests are dangerous, and we will not conduct them,\" Harris said in a speech to the base's military personnel, noting how the resulting debris can endanger the lives of astronauts and imperil satellites that provide \"the daily weather forecast, GPS driving directions, and even your favorite television station.\" Harris said she hoped the U.S. action would spur other countries to join in halting such tests. \"The United States is committed to lead the way and to lead by example,\" she said. The U.S. appears in 2008 to have last used a missile to destroy a satellite that was malfunctioning. U.S. officials said that within a week all the resulting debris had left the orbit. The invasion of Ukraine escalated tensions between Washington and Moscow over how the countries intend to explore space. It also resulted in the halting of direct talks between Washington and Moscow over international rules on space-based missile defenses. Russian President Vladimir Putin has signaled he intends to expand Moscow's space weapons program. The U.S. has imposed a raft of harsh economic sanctions, including some aimed at the Russian space industry. It is not clear how the invasion will affect operations of the International Space Station, which is operated jointly by the U.S., Russia and other countries. The station, which has been in operation for more than two decades, has been heralded as an example of post-Cold War cooperation. The Trump and Biden administrations have ramped up efforts to counter competition from Russia and China in space. Trump created the Space Force as a new branch of the military, while Biden has continued to invest in its existence. The White House budget request unveiled last month included $24.5 billion for the Space Force, a nearly 40% bump over the previous year and nearly the $26 billion Biden requested for NASA. Before delivering her remarks at Vandenberg, Harris received a briefing from military personnel on U.S. efforts in space and the dangers posed by anti-satellite missiles. She was next to fly to Los Angeles, where she was scheduled to appear at a Democratic fundraiser Monday night. Harris, who has a home in Brentwood and served as one of California's two U.S. senators before ascending to the vice presidency, is scheduled to deliver a speech in San Francisco on maternal health on Thursday before returning to Washington on Monday.",

Im proud of what we accomplished the last three years, but theres some unfinished business. I came to UCLA to win a national championship; shouldnt that be the goal? I want to hang banner No. 12 in Pauley Pavilion.\nThe Bruins prospects for their first national title since 1995 are greatly enhanced by the return of their grittiest and best all-around player who became a two-way force last season despite playing most of it on two bad ankles.\nOn the way to becoming a first-team All-Pac-12 player who also held the distinction of making the conferences all-defensive team for a second consecutive season, Jaquez averaged 13.9 points and 5.7 rebounds per game. He was especially effective while unleashing a slew of effective low-post moves late in the season, averaging 19.3 points over his final eight games as the Bruins reached the Sweet 16 before losing to North Carolina.\nAdvertisement\nHis decision wasnt wholly unexpected considering Jaquezs affinity for his teammates and coaches, not to mention the sister who will arrive on campus next fall. Gabriela Jaquez, the record-setting senior guard at Camarillo High, will join Jaime as the first basketball brother-sister combination at UCLA since Dave and Ann Meyers in the 1970s. The siblings have already secured at least one name, image and likeness deal alongside their younger brother, Marcos.\nJaime Jaquez is the first of the teams starters to publicly commit to coming back next season; Cody Riley and Jules Bernard were honored during senior day but have remaining eligibility and juniors Johnny Juzang and Tyger Campbell have not announced their plans.\nUCLA Sports\nOnce homeless, UCLAs Zaylon Thomas makes his mark on the track\nUCLA track and field athlete Zaylon Thomas battled homelessness in middle and high school. Hes now critical to the Bruins sprint and jumping teams.\nLong a fan favorite for his relentlessness, Jaquezs return ensures that the Bruins will keep a prominent part of the core that helped them reach the Final Four a year ago. Freshman guard Peyton Watson recently announced he was entering the NBA draft and junior guard Jake Kyman said he was transferring to Wyoming.\nJaquez will enter his senior season ranked No. 49 on the schools all-time scoring list (1,143 career points), having become one of 59 players in program history to tally 1,000 points.\nJaime has been a tremendous and tenacious player in our program for three years, and we are thrilled that he will come back for his senior season in Westwood, UCLA coach Mick Cronin said in a statement. Jaime has a chance to go down with so many other great Bruins in UCLA history who have played four seasons in front of the Pauley Pavilion faithful.\nJaquez moved into the starting lineup just eight games into his freshman season after challenging his teammates to be tougher, a standard he had already begun to uphold. Adding to his own legacy of resilience this season, Jaquez quickly returned from hitting his head on the Pauley Pavilion hardwood and getting accidentally elbowed in the face by teammate Myles Johnson. He repeatedly rolled his ankles and also dealt with inflammation, necessitating protective ankle braces for the seasons final six weeks.",

      "description": "With Elon Musk pushing a plan to take the company private, Twitter shares gained Monday amid speculation its board of directors will strike a deal that is more palatable to shareholders.",
      "body": "Twitter Inc. shares posted their biggest gain in two weeks Monday after the social media company launched a poison pill defense to thwart an unsolicited bid by Elon Musk to take the company private at $54.20 a share. A securities filing Monday confirmed the defense strategy Twitter outlined last week, which would allow the company to issue new stock that all shareholders except Musk could buy at a discounted price. It imposes a significant penalty on any person or entity that would acquire more than 15% of the company without board approval, according to the filing. Musk currently owns just over 9% of Twitter shares. The board adopted the rights agreement to protect stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics, according to the filing. Twitter shares rose 7.5% to $48.45 on Monday, their biggest jump since April 4. Twitter is using the poison pill defense to buy time to come up with a plan that would be in the best interests of its shareholders, according to a person familiar with the company. The shares are rising amid speculation that Twitter will strike a deal that is more palatable to shareholders. The company has been fielding takeover interest from other parties, including technology-focused private equity firm Thoma Bravo, according to a person familiar with the matter. Private equity firm Silver Lake, which already owns a significant stake in Twitter, also would make sense as a partner because it has an existing relationship with Musk as well, but its unclear whether it's interested. Meanwhile, Musk may partner with Oracle Corp. and a private equity consortium that includes Thoma Bravo to thwart Twitters poison pill, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts, while raising the bid 10-15% to about $50 billion. Musk, for his part, has said that any rejection of his bid, valuing Twitter at $43 billion, would cause him to reevaluate his stake. Over the weekend, Musk said that the economic interests of Twitters board arent aligned with shareholders. He was responding to a tweet about board members stock holdings, saying that with the impending departure of co-founder Jack Dorsey, the board collectively owns almost no shares. In a tweet Monday, Musk, who is chief executive of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, said that if his Twitter bid succeeds, board members would not be given a salary. Tesla has paid its own directors an annual cash retainer of about $20,000 plus certain additional fees in recent years, but they also each receive stock option grants every few years  meaning they stand to make tens of millions of dollars or more with Teslas stock price gains. Since making the Twitter offer last week, Musk has been actively posting on his Twitter account in what appears to be a social media campaign to sway public opinion in favor of his bid. The billionaire entrepreneur floated a cryptic tweet with the word tender, a likely wink-and-nod reference to a potential tender offer. If Musk is serious about pushing ahead with his takeover offer for Twitter, he should launch a tender offer to acquire the shares in the company he doesnt already own despite the poison pill, said Andrew Freedman, co-chair of the shareholder activism practice at law firm Olshan Frome Wolosky. Even though Musk wouldnt be able to close his tender offer, even with a majority of shares tendered, given the poison pill and other impediments, its a put your money where your mouth is type move and shows he really wants to buy this company, Freedman said. Musk could simultaneously launch a proxy contest in which he would ask shareholders to withhold their votes for the two directors who will stand for reelection at this years annual meeting, which is slated for May 25, Freedman said. That would serve as a referendum on his offer and allow him to solicit votes for an amendment to the companys charter to declassify the board, meaning that all directors, not just a few, would stand for election each year, he said. Last year, a similar proposal almost achieved the 80% vote threshold required to change the companys bylaws, he said. If Musk doesnt act in the next few months, he wont be able to do much at Twitter until next years annual general meeting because the company doesnt allow shareholders to call a special meeting or act by written consent. Freedman said that both Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal and Chairman Bret Taylor will stand for reelection next year. Dorsey is scheduled to leave the board once his term expires at the next shareholder meeting. If Musk can get fairly widespread support this year, it also could force the companys hand to negotiate with Musk earlier than they would like to or announce and run a sale process. All to avoid facing the music next year, he said. Bloomberg writer Sean O'Kane contributed to this report.",

The Las Vegas Review-Journal, citing unnamed sources, identified the most seriously injured person as Aaliyah Gayles, an 18-year-old basketball star at Spring Valley High in Las Vegas who was a McDonalds All-American. Gayles is originally from the Los Angeles area. She recommitted to USC after originally decommitting because of changes on the Trojans' coaching staff. Aaliyah is one of the strongest, most resilient young people I have ever known, USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. I have no doubt she will continue to face this unfathomable situation with courage and resolve. We will continue to support her and her parents in every way that we possibly can. One female adult victim received multiple gunshot wounds to her lower extremities and was hospitalized in serious condition, Booker said in a statement. The other three victims were reported to be in stable condition, he said. A large group of people left the area before police arrived Saturday night, and a suspect in the shooting was not immediately identified. Booker said no arrests were immediately made.",

      "body": "7:05 p.m. EDT\nLoading...\nFirefighters work to extinguish a fire after an airstrike hit a tire shop in Lviv, Ukraine, on April 18. (Mykola Tys/AP)\nPlaceholder while article actions load\nLVIV, Ukraine  Russia appeared on Monday to launch its anticipated ground offensive in eastern Ukraine as Moscow stepped up missile and artillery strikes across the country in some of the broadest attacks in recent weeks.\nArrowRight\nNow we can state that the Russian forces have started the battle for the Donbas that they have been getting ready for a long time, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video message, referring to the contested eastern region that many analysts expect will see some of the bloodiest fighting of the war. A very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive.\nOleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraines national security and defense council, said Russian forces attacked along nearly the entire front line in Donbas and Kharkiv, breaking through in two small cities. Fortunately, our military is holding on, Danilov said.\nAdvertisement\nThe Pentagon did not contradict the Ukrainian assessment but took a more cautious approach, with spokesman John Kirby saying the Russians are shaping and setting the conditions for future offensive operations with hundreds of missile strikes and artillery barrages.\nAt the same time, the relative calm that western Ukraine has largely enjoyed after more than 50 days of war was shattered when Russian missiles struck the city of Lviv, killing at least seven people and injuring 11, including a child. Regional officials said they were the first deaths recorded inside the limits of the city, which has been a safe haven for displaced Ukrainians and foreign diplomats, as well as aid workers and journalists.\nIn Bucha, the story of one mans body left on a Russian killing field\nA preliminary assessment indicated the strikes were launched from airplanes that came from the direction of the Caspian Sea, the regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, said at a news conference. Officials said the Russian forces hit a military warehouse as well as a commercial service station where local drivers go for tire repairs and carwashes. The warehouse was not being used by the military when it was hit, Kozytskyi said.\nAdvertisement\nIn a hotel next to the service station, 32-year-old Kostiantyn Pospelov said he prepared to run when he heard explosions but only had time to pull on his jacket and one sock before another blast blew out the windows and shook the hotel. Pospelov was staying there with roughly 80 other guests who had arrived in the last month from hard-hit cities in the south and east.\nDozens of families sought shelter in the hotel, Volodymyr Tereshko, the manager, recounted. Curtains fluttered out of gaping holes that had been windows of guest rooms.\nNo military! Civilian people! Children! Fathers, mothers, Tereshko said, insisting on English so that people in the West understood who was paying the price for Russias onslaught.\nWhy Russia gave up on urban war in Kyiv and turned to big battles in the east\nMondays attack punctured that bubble of normal life. Residents who said they often shrug off air raid sirens filed into underground bunkers, where they traded Telegram messages in search of information about the blasts. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said on social media that the entire country was vulnerable to Russian assault: Today in Ukraine there are no safe and unsafe cities.\nAdvertisement\nAt the scene of the auto shop strike, firefighters doused flames and emergency crews picked through the rubble of the two-story building, its roof now ripped off. Smaller buildings on the site were also badly damaged. The smell of burning rubber wafted through the air; charred tires sat in piles.\nEvgenii Laziuk, 49, who lives in the area, shook his head as he looked at the ruins of what he called a fully civilian target. He said the shop owner is well-known in the community, a father of five whose extended family is involved in the business.\nIts like having a big wallet and throwing it away, Laziuk said. He was feeding his family with it, and now hes been left with nothing.\nDespite the strike on a civilian structure, the Pentagon said the attacks on Monday seemed to be aimed at military targets and did not signal that Russia was expanding its war into the west of Ukraine. A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under terms set by the Pentagon, denied that the Russian attacks struck any weapons shipments from the United States or Ukraines other allies.\nAdvertisement\nTo the south, Russian forces continued their devastating assault on the strategic port city of Mariupol, focusing on a sprawling industrial complex that houses the Azovstal steel plant. Moscow had imposed a deadline for Ukrainian forces to surrender, but as of Monday, they had refused.\nHow a Mariupol steel plant became a holdout for the citys resistance\nA Ukrainian commander who is still fighting alongside soldiers in the city made a desperate plea to Western leaders, including President Biden, for help to evacuate civilians hiding in military bunkers.\nWe beg the world for help in evacuating the wounded, children, women and the bodies of the dead, said Maj. Serhiy Volyna, with the 36th Separate Marine Brigade in a letter posted on his Facebook page. The brigade is one of the groups holed up at the steel plant, the last line of Ukraines defense preventing Russia from taking over the city.\nAdvertisement\nWe call on world politicians, public and religious figures not to be indifferent to people who have fallen into the trap of Mariupol against their will, Volyna wrote in the letter also shared on\nTwitter\nby a city official from Kyiv.\nUkraines prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said Sunday that the last forces in Mariupol will fight till the end.\nIn the eastern region of Luhansk, leaders urged citizens to urgently evacuate amid a fresh Russian push that killed at least six people.\nThe Pentagon says Russian forces are learning from their failed assault on Kyiv as they shift to Donbas, in an attempt to avoid a repeat of earlier mistakes.\nThey are moving in heavy artillery, they are moving in command-and-control enablers, they are moving in aviation, the senior defense official said. It appears they are trying to learn from the lessons of the North, where they didnt have proper sustainment capabilities.\nAdvertisement\nStill, Russias efforts to buttress its war machine with repair and resupply capabilities is unlikely to solve its overarching problems with preparedness, the official said. Sanctions have affected the Russian forces restocking efforts particularly in the realm of components, the official said. A lack of parts, the official said, is affecting the viability of several Russian weapons systems, including precision-guided munitions.\nThey have already faced an issue in terms of replenishing their inventory because of components of some of these systems, the official",

      "body": "Email\nBOSTON (AP)  Jorge Polanco and Kyle Garlick hit early two-run homers over the Green Monster to back Dylan Bundy, carrying the Minnesota Twins past the Red Sox 8-3 in Bostons annual Patriots Day game on Monday.\nThe game started at 11:11 a.m. EDT, played in conjunction with the 126th Boston Marathon, which ended about one mile from Fenway Park.\nPolanco added a two-run single in a four-run eighth inning and Gio Urshela had three singles for the Twins, who won the series finale for a four-game split.\nChristian Vzquez hit a solo homer and Xander Bogaerts had three hits with an RBI for the Red Sox.\nAdvertisement:\nBundy (2-0) gave up one run and five hits in 5 1/3 innings with six strikeouts and no walks. In his Twins debut, he pitched five shutout innings after signing a $4 million, one-year deal as a free agent on December 1.\nA few minutes after fans were turning on the back of the Monster attempting to get a glimpse at the mens leaders of the race heading toward nearby Kenmore Square, Polanco hit his drive into the second row of seats off starter Rich Hill (0-1) that made it 4-0 in the third.\nHill was pitching three days after his 94-year-old father, Lloyd Sr., passed away. His dad ran 37 Boston Marathons.\nWe want to send our thoughts to Rich across the way, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said before the game. Im sure itll be an emotional and very meaningful day for him.\nHill gave up four runs and six hits in 4 2/3 innings.\nGarlicks homer made it 2-0 in the first.\nNEIGHBORHOOD PLAY\nThe Red Sox have been scheduled on Patriots Day every year since 1959 but it was the first time since 2019 they played on the day of the marathon. The 2020 baseball season was delayed and that years marathon held virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2021 marathon was moved to October.\nAdvertisement:\nTRIBUTE\nThe Red Sox wore their traditional white home uniforms, but with red lettering that read Boston across the front, a tribute that started nine years ago in the first game after two bombs went off near the finish line, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others.\nTRAINERS ROOM\nTwins: Baldelli met with OF Byron Buxton, who left the series opener after aggravating his right knee on a hard slide. Hes very optimistic about how hes feeling right now, Baldelli said. I think were going to get to the point in the next day or two where were going to talk about a specific plan about getting him back. Buxton had an MRI on Saturday that didnt reveal any structural issues.\nRed Sox: INF Trevor Story had the day off.  C Kevin Plawecki was placed on the COVID-19 related injured list, and C Connor Wong was recalled from Triple-A Worcester.\nUP NEXT\nTwins: Begin a three-game series in Kansas City on Tuesday. RHP Chris Archer (0-0, 0.00 ERA) is scheduled to make his second start after pitching four scoreless innings last week. RHP Carlos Hernndez (0-0, 8.31) is in line for the Royals.\nRed Sox: Open a three-game series against the Blue Jays in their first night game of the season at Fenway Park Tuesday. RHP Nathan Eovaldi (1-0, 4.50) is slated to face Toronto LHP Yusei Kikuchi (0-1, 5.40).\nAdvertisement:",
