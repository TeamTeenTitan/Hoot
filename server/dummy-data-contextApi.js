      "body": "Email\nAdvertisement:\nCHERNOBYL, Ukraine (AP)  Here in the dirt of one of the worlds most radioactive places, Russian soldiers dug trenches. Ukrainian officials worry they were, in effect, digging their own graves.\nAdvertisement:\nAdvertisement:\nAdvertisement:\nThousands of tanks and troops rumbled into the forested Chernobyl exclusion zone in the earliest hours of Russias invasion of Ukraine in February, churning up highly contaminated soil from the site of the 1986 accident that was the worlds worst nuclear disaster.\nAdvertisement:\nAdvertisement:\nFor more than a month, some Russian soldiers bunked in the earth within sight of the massive structure built to contain radiation from the damaged Chernobyl nuclear reactor. A close inspection of their trenches was impossible because even walking on the dirt is discouraged.\nAs the 36th anniversary of the April 26, 1986, disaster approaches and Russias invasion continues, its clear that Chernobyl  a relic of the Cold War  was never prepared for this.\nWith scientists and others watching in disbelief from afar, Russian forces flew over the long-closed plant, ignoring the restricted airspace around it. They held personnel still working at the plant at gunpoint during a marathon shift of more than a month, with employees sleeping on tabletops and eating just twice a day.\nEven now, weeks after the Russians left, I need to calm down, the plants main security engineer, Valerii Semenov, told The Associated Press. He worked 35 days straight, sleeping only three hours a night, rationing cigarettes and staying on even after the Russians allowed a shift change.\nI was afraid they would install something and damage the system, he said in an interview.\nWorkers kept the Russians from the most dangerous areas, but in what Semenov called the worst situation he has seen in his 30 years at Chernobyl, the plant was without electricity, relying on diesel generators to support the critical work of circulating water for cooling the spent fuel rods.\nIt was very dangerous to act in this way, said Maksym Shevchuck, the deputy head of the state agency managing the exclusion zone. He was scared by it all.\nRussias invasion marks the first time that occupying a nuclear plant was part of a nations war strategy, said Rebecca Harms, former president of the Greens group in the European Parliament, who has visited Chernobyl several times. She called it a nightmare scenario in which every nuclear plant can be used like a pre-installed nuclear bomb.\nA visit to the exclusion zone, more desolate than usual, found that the invasion risked a catastrophe worse than the original explosion and fire at Chernobyl that sent radioactive material into the atmosphere and became a symbol of the Soviet Unions stumbling final years. Billions of dollars were spent by the international community, including Russia, to stabilize and secure the area.\nNow authorities are working with Ukraines defense ministry on ways to protect Chernobyls most critical places. At the top of the list are anti-drone systems and anti-tank barriers, along with a system to protect against warplanes and helicopters.\nNone of it will matter much if Russian President Vladimir Putin resorts to nuclear weapons, which Shevchuck says he cant rule out anymore.\nI understand they can use any kind of weapon and they can do any awful thing, he said.\nChernobyl needs special international protection with a robust U.N. mandate, Harms said. As with the original disaster, the risks are not only to Ukraine but to nearby Belarus and beyond.\nIt depends from where the wind blows, she said.\nAfter watching thousands of Soviet soldiers work to contain the effects of the 1986 accident, sometimes with no protection, Harms and others were shocked at the Russian soldiers disregard for safety, or their ignorance, in the recent invasion.\nSome soldiers even stole highly radioactive materials as souvenirs or possibly to sell.\nI think from movies they have the imagination that all dangerous small things are very valuable, Shevchuck said.\nHe believes hundreds or thousands of soldiers damaged their health, likely with little idea of the consequences, despite plant workers warnings to their commanders.\nMost of the soldiers were around 20 years old, he said. All these actions proves that their management, and in Russia in general, human life equals like zero.\nThe full extent of Russias activities in the Chernobyl exclusion zone is still unknown, especially because the troops scattered mines that the Ukrainian military is still searching for. Some have detonated, further disturbing the radioactive ground. The Russians also set several forest fires, which have been put out.\nUkrainian authorities cant monitor radiation levels across the zone because Russian soldiers stole the main server for the system, severing the connection on March 2. The International Atomic Energy Agency said Saturday it still wasnt receiving remote data from its monitoring systems. The Russians even took Chernobyl staffers personal radiation monitors.\nIn the communications center, one of the buildings in the zone not overgrown by nature, the Russians looted and left a carpet of shattered glass. The building felt deeply of the 1980s, with a map on a wall still showing the Soviet Union. Someone at some point had taken a pink marker and traced Ukraines border.\nIn normal times, about 6,000 people work in the zone, about half of them at the nuclear plant. When the Russians invaded, most workers were told to evacuate immediately. Now about 100 are left at the nuclear plant and 100 are elsewhere.\nSemenov, the security engineer, recalled the Russians checking the remaining workers for what they called radicals.\nWe said, Look at our documents, 90% of us are originally from Russia, he said. But were patriots of our country, meaning Ukraine.\nWhen the Russians hurriedly departed March 31 as part of a withdrawal from the region that left behind scorched tanks and traumatized communities, they took more than 150 Ukrainian national guard members into Belarus. Shevchuck fears theyre now in Russia.\nIn their rush, the Russians gave nuclear plant managers a choice: Sign a document saying the soldiers had protected the site and there were no complaints, or be taken into Belarus. The managers signed.\nOne protective measure the Russians did appear to take was leaving open a line routing communications from the nuclear plant through the workers town of Slavutych and on to authorities in Ukraines capital, Kyiv. It was used several times, Shevchuck said.\nI think they understood it should be for their safety, he said. The IAEA said Tuesday the plant is now able to contact Ukraines nuclear regulator directly.\nAnother Ukrainian nuclear plant, at Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine, remains under Russian control. It is the largest in Europe.\nShevchuck, like other Ukrainians, has had it with Putin.\nWere inviting him inside the new safe confinement shelter, he said. Then we will close it.\nBe ",

      "body": "Email\nAdvertisement:\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP)  An unexpectedly sharp drop in subscribers has Netflix considering changes it has long resisted: Minimizing password sharing and creating a low-cost subscription supported by advertising.\nAdvertisement:\nAdvertisement:\nAdvertisement:\nLooming changes announced late Tuesday are designed to help Netflix regain momentum lost over the past year. Pandemic-driven lockdowns that drove binge-watching have lifted, while deep-pocketed rivals such as Apple and Walt Disney have begun to chip away at its vast audience with their own streaming services.\nAdvertisement:\nAdvertisement:\nNetflixs customer base fell by 200,000 subscribers during the January-March quarter, the first contraction the streaming service has seen since it became available throughout most of the world other than China six years ago. The drop stemmed in part from Netflixs decision to withdraw from Russia to protest the war against Ukraine, resulting in a loss of 700,000 subscribers. Netflix projected a loss of another 2 million subscribers in the current April-June quarter.\nThe erosion, coming off a year of progressively slower growth, has rattled Netflix investors. Shares plunged by more than 25% in extended trading after Netflix revealed its disappointing performance. If the stock drop extends into Wednesdays regular trading session, Netflix shares will have lost more than half of their value so far this year  wiping out about $150 billion in shareholder wealth in less than four months.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company estimated that about 100 million households worldwide are watching its service for free by using the account of a friend or another family member, including 30 million in the U.S. and Canada.\nThose are over 100 million households already are choosing to view Netflix, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said. Weve just got to get paid at some degree for them.\nTo prod more people to pay for their own accounts, Netflix indicated it will expand a trial program it has been running in three Latin American countries  Chile, Costa Rica and Peru. In these locations, subscribers can extend service to another household for a discounted price. In Costa Rica, for instance, Netflix plan prices range from $9 to $15 a month but subscribers can openly share their servicewith another household for $3.\nNetflix offered no additional information about how a cheaper ad-supported service tier would work or how much it would cost. Another rival, Hulu, has long offered an ad-supported tier.\nWhile Netflix clearly believes these changes will help it build upon its current 221.6 million worldwide subscribers, the moves also risk alienating customers to the point they cancel.\nNetflix was previously stung by a customer backlash in 2011 when it unveiled plans to begin charging for its then-nascent streaming service, which had been bundled for free with its traditional DVD-by-mail service before its international expansion. In the months after that change, Netflix lost 800,000 subscribers, prompting an apology from Hastings for botching the execution of the spin-off.\nTuesdays announcement was a sobering comedown for a company that was buoyed two years ago when millions of consumers corralled at home were desperately seeking diversions  a void Netflix was happy to fill. Netflix added 36 million subscribers during 2020, by far the largest annual growth since its video streaming services debut in 2007.\nBut Hastings now believes those outsized gains may have blinded management. COVID created a lot of noise on how to read the situation, he said in a video conference Tuesday.\nNetflix began heading in a new direction last year when its service added video gamesat no additional charge in an attempt to give people another reason to subscribe.\nEscalating inflation over the past year has also squeezed household budgets, leading more consumers to rein in their spending on discretionary items. Despite that pressure, Netflix recently raised prices in the U.S., where it has its greatest household penetration  and where its had the most trouble finding more subscribers.\nIn the most recent quarter, Netflix lost 640,000 subscribers in the U.S. and Canada, prompting management to point out that most of its future growth will come in international markets. Netflix ended March with 74.6 million subscribers in the U.S. and Canada.\nBe civil.  Be kind.",

      "description": "Thousands of Sri Lankans take to the streets a day after police opened fire at demonstrators amid the countrys worst economic crisis in decades.",
      "body": "Thousands of people across Sri Lanka took to the streets Wednesday after police opened fire at demonstrators the day before in a crackdown that killed one person, injured 13 others and reignited widespread protests over the countrys worst economic crisis in decades. Protesters used vehicles to block key roads in many parts of the country as they demonstrated against the shooting as well as rising fuel prices and the governments failure to resolve the deepening economic problems. The shooting was the first by Sri Lankan security forces during weeks of protests. The violence occurred Tuesday in Rambukkana, 55 miles northeast of Colombo, the capital. Fifteen police officers were also admitted to a hospital with minor injuries after clashes with protesters. Police said the demonstrators had blocked railroad tracks and roads and ignored warnings to disperse. Police also said protesters threw rocks at them. Also Wednesday, thousands of bank, port, health and other state employees demonstrated in front of the main railway station in Colombo, condemning the police shooting and demanding that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa resign. They marched on the main road in front of the station shouting slogans and displaying placards that read Bring down the cost of living, Bow down to the people's verdict and Gota go home. Gota is a shortened version of Rajapaksa's first name. Rajapaksa has resisted calls to resign. Much of the anger expressed in weeks of growing protests has been directed at Rajapaksa and his elder brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, who head an influential clan that has been in power for most of the past two decades. Five other family members are lawmakers, three of whom resigned as ministers two weeks ago. Sri Lanka is on the brink of bankruptcy, with nearly $7 billion of its total $25 billion in foreign debt due for repayment this year. A severe shortage of foreign exchange means the country lacks money to buy imported goods. U.S. Ambassador Julie Chung and United Nations Resident Coordinator Hanaa Singer-Hamdy urged restraint from all sides and called on the authorities to ensure peoples right to peaceful protest. Chung also called for an independent investigation into the shooting. Sri Lankans have endured months of shortages of essentials such as food, cooking gas, fuel and medicine, lining up for hours to buy the limited stocks available. Fuel prices have risen several times in recent months, resulting in sharp increases in transport costs and prices of other goods. There was another round of increases earlier this week. Thousands of protesters continued to occupy the entrance to the presidents office for a 12th day Wednesday, blaming him for the economic crisis. Mahinda Rajapaksa said Tuesday that the constitution would be changed to clip presidential powers and empower Sri Lanka's Parliament. The prime minister said the power shift was a quick step that could be taken to stabilize the country politically and help talks with the International Monetary Fund over an economic recovery plan. Gotabaya Rajapaksa concentrated power in the presidency after being elected in 2019. The Rajapaksa brothers are likely to retain their grip on power even if the constitution is amended, since they hold the highest offices. Both the president and prime minister have refused to step down, resulting in a political impasse. Opposition parties have rejected the presidents proposal of a unity government but have been unable to put together a majority in Parliament and form a new government.",

      "body": "Shanghai allowed 4 million more people out of their homes Wednesday as anti-coronavirus controls that shut down China's biggest city eased, while the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast of Chinese economic growth and warned that the global flow of industrial goods might be disrupted. A total of nearly 12 million people in the city of 25 million are now allowed outdoors following the first round of easing of restrictions last week, health official Wu Ganyu told news conference. Wu said the virus was under effective control for the first time in some parts of the city. Under the latest changes, more than 4 million people are included in areas where the status shifted from \"closed\" to \"controlled,\" said Wu. He said some are not allowed to leave their neighborhoods, and large gatherings are prohibited. Meanwhile, the IMF reduced its forecast of Chinese growth this year to 4.4% from 4.8% because of the shutdowns of Shanghai and other industrial centers. That is down by almost half from last year's 8.1% growth and below the ruling Communist Party's 5.5% target. Chinas case numbers in its latest infection surge are relatively low, but the ruling party is enforcing a zero-tolerance COVID strategy that has shut down major cities to contain even the smallest of outbreaks. On Wednesday, the government reported 19,927 new cases on the Chinese mainland, all but 2,761 of which had no symptoms. Shanghai accounted for 95% of the total, or 18,902 cases, of which 2,495 had symptoms. The Shanghai city health agency reported that seven people who had COVID-19 died Tuesday but said the deaths were due to cancer, heart disease and other ailments. All but two were over 60. Shanghai shut down businesses and confined most residents to their homes starting March 28 after a spike in infections. That led to complaints about lack of access to supplies of food and medicine. People in Shanghai who test positive but have no symptoms have been ordered into quarantine centers set up in exhibition halls and other public buildings. Official data this week showed economic growth in the first three months of this year declined compared with the final quarter of 2021. The lockdowns in China \"will likely compound supply disruptions elsewhere and might add to pressure for inflation to rise, the IMF said in a report. The ruling party has promised tax refunds and other aid to businesses but is avoiding large-scale stimulus spending. Economists say that the strategy will take longer to show results and that Beijing might need to spend more or cut interest rates. Chinese leaders have promised to try to reduce the human and economic cost of anti-disease controls by shifting to a dynamic clearing strategy that isolates neighborhoods and other smaller areas instead of whole cities. However, many areas appear to be enforcing more stringent controls after Shanghai officials were criticized for not acting aggressively enough. Also Wednesday, the Ministry of Agriculture ordered local officials to avoid any measures that might interfere with spring planting by the farmers who help feed China's 1.4 billion people. The order followed warnings that production of wheat and other crops might be disrupted, which would boost demand for imports and push up already-high global prices. The government reported that 26,760 people who tested positive but had no symptoms were released Wednesday from observation. That included 25,411 in Shanghai, where some residents of quarantine centers have complained that they are unsanitary. Other industrial and trading centers, including Changchun, Jilin and Shenyang in the northeast; the port of Tianjin, east of Beijing; and Shenzhen and Guangzhou in the south have closed businesses, imposed travel restrictions or told told residents to stay home. Global automakers and other manufacturers reduced or stopped production because suppliers couldnt deliver. This week, Volkswagen announced that its Changchun factory had resumed production and that it was considering when its Shanghai facility would reopen. BMW said its factory in Shenyang reopened. While some cities were easing controls, the government of Harbin, a city of 5.3 million in the northeast, suspended bus and subway service Wednesday and barred people from moving between districts.",

      "body": "ArrowRight\nIt lost 700,000 viewers in Russia, although it added 500,000 viewers elsewhere globally.\nThe drop comes amid a larger trend of shrinking viewership, with the streaming service projecting that it will lose a further 2 million subscribers in the next three-month quarter ending in June.\nIt still said revenue would grow to almost $8 billion in that period, a 10 percent increase from the same time last year. The company also retains a paying audience of over 220 million, more than double what it had five years ago.\nAdvertisement\nBut the unexpected drop in paying viewers  the company had said in January it expected paying customers to increase by 2.5 million  reflects a steady slowdown in business. The company cited increased competition and a fizzling of the pandemic-triggered growth in paying viewers, which pushed more people toward at-home entertainment options.\nTo address the slump, Netflix said it would seek to monetize the millions of nonpaying viewers who have benefited from account-sharing. The company estimates that 100 million households, including over 30 million in the United States and Canada, are sharing accounts.\n[Account sharing]s not a new thing, said Reed Hastings, Netflix co-chief executive, speaking to investors via video. Were working on how to monetize sharing, he said. Remember, these are 100 million households that already are choosing to view Netflix. They love the service.

We got great competition. Theyve got some very good shows and films, he said without naming specific rivals or movies. What we got to do is take it up a notch. In its letter, Netflix listed Disney Plus as one of the traditional entertainment companies to realize streaming is the future.\nOver the long run, Netflix said it sees growth to mostly come from outside the United States. It will double down on producing content that can be made anywhere and loved everywhere, Netflix said, pointing to non-English language hits produced outside America such as South Koreas Squid Game, All of Us Are Dead, and Spains Money Heist.\nThe company recorded $1.6 billion in net income during the January-March period, up from $607 million reported in the October-December 2021 quarter, but roughly a 6 percent drop from last years first quarter.

      "body": "Copied!\nPrint\nSome fans cheered. Others booed. But when Kenley Jansenmade his return to the Dodger Stadium mound, toeing the rubber at Chavez Ravine in another teams uniform for the first time in his career, everyone in attendance Tuesday night was on their feet.\nThe\nDodgers\n longtime closer had returned to Los Angeles and was back in his element.\nAnd Jansen earned the save against his former team in the Atlanta Braves 3-1 win ending the game with a flyout by former Braves star Freddie Freeman.\nAfter 12 seasons with the Dodgers, Jansen signed with the Braves as a free agent in the offseason, joining the defending World Series champions on a one-year, $16-million contract.\nBefore Mondays series opener, Jansen talked to reporters about the difficulty of the transition and the emotions that came with his exodus from Los Angeles. He greeted old teammates in the clubhouse in the afternoon. Then, on the field, he was warmly received during a pregame ceremony, joined on the field by Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, third baseman Justin Turner and president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman.\nAdvertisement\nJust to see the reception he got from the fans, it really was great, Roberts said. You could see him getting a little bit emotional.\nDodgers\nHernndez: Clayton Kershaws competitive fire rages even as Dodger fans show him love\nClayton Kershaw had difficulty appreciating a standing ovation at Dodger Stadium after the Atlanta Braves knocked him out in the sixth inning of a win.\nRoberts had hoped it would be the last the Dodgers saw of Jansen this week, and the closer didnt stir in Mondays 7-4 loss to L.A.\nBut with the Braves leading by two going into the bottom of the ninth Tuesday, Jansen came trotting out of the right-field bullpen at Dodger Stadium for the first time in his career.\nAfter getting Will Smith to fly out and Mookie Betts to swing through a trademark cutter for a strikeout, Jansen fittingly faced Freeman  who is facing the Braves this week for the first time since signing with the Dodgers this spring. The All-Star slugger homered Monday in his first at-bat against his old team.\nFreeman, 0 for 4 Tuesday, got a hold of a sinker down the middle but watched the ball die in left-center field for the final out. He walked back to the Dodgers dugout. Jansen celebrated on the mound with his new team.\nThe Dodgers had been frustrated long before their former closer ended the game.\nFacing Braves ace Max Fried, the Dodgers star-studded lineup was kept silent for most of the night, managing just two hits against the former Studio City Harvard-Westlake standout.\nFried retired the first 15 Dodgers, carrying a perfect game into the sixth inning before Hanser Alberto lined a single to right. After that inning ended with a double-play, Fried didnt face more than the minimum until the seventh, when he stranded an infield single by Trea Turner with three strikeouts  giving him eight on the night.\nThe Dodgers also had their ace pitching. But in a five-inning, three-run start, Walker Buehler still struggled to capture his normal, dominant form to start the season.\nAtlanta Braves Eddie Rosario, right, scores on a double by Orlando Arcia as Dodgers catcher Austin Barnes takes a late throw during the fourth inning on Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.\n(Mark J. Terrill / Associated Press)\nSeveral times, the frustration showed.\nWhen Travis dArnaud went deep in the second inning, hammering a first-pitch fastball over the middle of the plate to open the scoring with a solo home run, Buehler appeared annoyed, fidgeting with a new ball while the Braves catcher rounded the bases.\nWhen Eddie Rosario lined a two-strike single to right to begin the fourth inning, setting him up to later score on an RBI double from Orlando Arcia, Buehler looked irritated, stomping into his landing spot on the mound.\nAnd even after he limited damage in the fifth inning, getting a deep flyout to strand a runner at second an at-bat after Austin Riley drove in a run with a check-swing single, Buehler seemed discontent, trudging off the field for the final time.\nIn all, Buehler gave up eight hits (his most in an outing since September 2019), struck out just two batters (his fewest in a Dodger Stadium start since September 2019) and finished the game with a 4.02 earned-run average through three starts (higher than he had at any point last year).\nThe Dodgers scratched across one run in the eighth, after Chris Taylor drew a walk, advanced to third on a wild pitch, then scored on an Alberto ground ball.\nBut that was all they could muster. In the ninth, they faced what so many of their opponents had for a dozen years, becoming the victims of Jansens 186th career save at Dodger Stadium  and first to be completed in the bottom of the ninth.\nDodgers\nBaseball reveres Jackie Robinson, but Robinson didnt revere baseball. Heres why\nIn 1972, 25 years after he broke MLBs color barrier, Robinson reflected on the ongoing fight for equality. Former Times sportswriter Ron Rapoport recounts that interview just months before Robinsons death.\nInjury updates\nGavin Lux was scratched from the lineup after experiencing back tightness before the game. The Dodgers didnt immediately indicate the severity of Luxs injury.\nReliever Blake Treinen also was unavailable, as he continues to nurse an arm injury. Treinen will throw off a mound Wednesday, in hopes of returning to game action as soon as Friday.\nDodgers",

And I managed it like a playoff game, said Boston manager Alex Cora, who used five pitchers. I went for the win.\nAdvertisement:\nWe will be better. We want more than two runs, obviously, but today it was enough to win the game.\nAdvertisement:\nKik Hernndez and Trevor Story had back-to-back doubles in the third for Boston.\nAdvertisement:\nZack Collins homered for the Blue Jays off starter Nathan Eovaldi.\nAdvertisement:\nWong was called up from the minors Monday to replace catcher Kevin Plawecki, who went on the COVID-19 injured list.\nI think its a good opportunity, but the main objective is just to win, win as many games as we can, and while Im here thats what Im going to do, Wong said. If I perform well and we win, its even better.\nBatting ninth and facing right-hander Yimi Garcia (0-1), Wong lofted a fly ball to right field that scored Bobby Dalbec, who opened the inning by reaching on an error by shortstop Bo Bichette.\nIt was Bichettes second error of the game, his first two this season.\nCollins home run leading off the second gave Toronto an early lead. Boston tied it the next inning on doubles by Hernndez and Story off Yusei Kikuchi.\nHansel Robles (1-0) threw 1 2/3 hitless innings in relief for the win. Garrett Whitlock pitched a perfect ninth for his first save of the season.\nKikuchi went five innings, giving up one run on three hits with three walks and a strikeout. Eovaldi was lifted with two outs in the fifth. He allowed a run on seven hits with six strikeouts.\nTRAINERS ROOM\nBlue Jays: RHP Nate Pearson, sidelined with mononucleosis, threw 36 pitches over two simulated innings in a bullpen session at Torontos spring training complex as the Blue Jays stretch him out to be a starter. He is expected to return by the middle of May.  LHP Hyun Jin Ryu, on the injured list with left forearm inflammation, Teoscar Hernandez (left oblique strain) and C Danny Jansen (left oblique strain) all stayed in Toronto to continue their rehab programs.  RHP Julian Merryweather is experiencing right knee discomfort. He will continue to pitch but will wear a knee brace.\nRed Sox: Boston added C Christian Vazquez and INF Jonathan Arauz to the COVID-19 injured list. RHP Tyler Danish and OF Rob Refsnyder were called up to take their spots on the roster.\nOTHER MOVES\nRed Sox LHP Rich Hill, whose father died Friday, was placed on the bereavement list. C Ronaldo Hernandez was called up to replace Hill on the roster.\nUP NEXT\nBlue Jays: Although RHP Jose Berrios (0-0, 11.81 ERA) is without a decision, Toronto has won each of his first two starts. In seven career games against the Red Sox, he is 0-5 with a 4.43 ERA. In three career games at Fenway Park, he is 0-3 with a 7.31 ERA. His lone appearance against Boston while with the Blue Jays came last Aug. 7 in Toronto, when he went six innings, allowing one run with six strikeouts and no walks.\nRed Sox: Nick Pivetta (0-2, 9.39) has had a rough start to the season, with Cora saying he would like to see improved mechanics from the right-hander. In seven career games against Toronto, Pivetta is 1-2 with a 5.77 ERA. He faced the Blue Jays five times in 2021, going 1-1 with a 5.93 ERA.\n___\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\nBe civil.  Be kind.",

Miller, an actor known for playing the Flash in \"Justice League\" films, pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct stemming from an arrest last month at a Hawaii karaoke bar. Hawaii State Judiciary via AP\nBy JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER, Associated Press\nApril 19, 2022\nEmail\nAdvertisement:\nHONOLULU (AP)  Ezra Miller was arrested on suspicion of assault early Tuesday, the second time the actor known for playing the Flash in Justice League films has been arrested in Hawaii in recent weeks.\nAdvertisement:\nAdvertisement:\nAdvertisement:\nMiller became irate after being asked to leave a get-together at a Big Island home and threw a chair, hitting a woman in the forehead, according to a news release from the Hawaii Police Department.\nAdvertisement:\nAdvertisement:\nThe woman refused treatment for a half-inch (1.3-centimeter) cut on her forehead, police said.\nMiller, described by police as a 29-year-old visitor from Vermont, was arrested during a traffic stop and released pending further investigation.\nAbout twelve hours after Millers arrest, the actor appeared via Zoom for a court hearing for an arrest last month at a Big Island karaoke bar.\nMiller pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct and was ordered to pay a $500 fine and stay away from Margarita Village in Hilo.\nMiller was also charged with harassment after police said the actor grabbed a mic from a singing woman and lunged at a man playing darts.\nMiller was aggravated by a rendition of the Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper ballad Shallow, Hawaii Police Assistant Chief Kenneth Quiocho said.\nAs part of a plea deal, prosecutors dropped the harassment charge, along with an unrelated traffic charge.\nMiller received a traffic citation after police were called to a dispute in downtown Hilo last month where Miller was uncooperative, refused to leave the area and obstructed a sidewalk, Quiocho said.\nMillers Hawaii attorney didnt immediately return a message seeking comment on the latest arrest. Another lawyer and a Miller representative also didnt immediately respond to messages requesting comment.\nThere was no mention of the latest arrest during the court hearing.\nBig Island attorney Francis Alcain had requested Tuesdays court hearing, previously scheduled for next week, be moved up. Alcain said in a court filing his client has various time sensitive work obligations in California and/or New York, and needs an earlier hearing to resolve this matter.\nThe day after Miller was released on $500 bail for the karaoke bar arrest, a Big Island couple filed a petition for a temporary restraining order, claiming the actor burst into their bedroom and threatened them. A judge dismissed the case last week after an attorney for the couple requested it.\nWilliam Dean, an attorney for the couple, declined to say why his clients no longer wanted to pursue a restraining order against Miller.\nJudge M. Kanani Laubach applied Millers bail to the $500 fine, leaving a $30 fee to pay.\nMiller also has a key role in the third installment of the Harry Potter spinoff Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore.\nBoston.com Today",

      "body": "Stocks overcame a weak start and finished broadly higher Tuesday, giving the major indexes on Wall Street their best day in nearly five weeks. The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 1.6%, enough to recoup almost all of its losses from last week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.5% and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.2%. The last time the indexes mounted a bigger rally was March 16. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq came into this week with two straight weekly losses, while the Dow has fallen three weeks in a row. Stocks have mostly struggled this year amid uncertainty over how the economy and corporate America will be affected as the Federal Reserve moves to reverse low-interest rate policies that helped markets soar in recent years. Were just getting a little bit of a bounce back from whats been a tough couple of weeks, said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. The S&P 500 rose 70.52 points to 4,462.21. The Dow recovered from a 17-point drop and climbed 499.51 points to 34,911.20. The Nasdaq gained 287.30 points to 13,619.66. Nearly 90% of the stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 rose. Technology stocks helped power the broad gains. Pricey valuations for many of the bigger technology companies give them more sway in directing the broader market higher or lower. Microsoft rose 1.7%. Retailers and healthcare companies also helped lift the market. Amazon rose 3.5%. Johnson & Johnson rose 3.1% after reporting surprisingly good earnings while also raising its dividend. Banks gained ground along with rising Treasury yields, which allow them to charge higher interest rates on loans. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.94% from 2.85% late Monday. Bank of America rose 1.9%. Smaller company stocks outpaced the broader market in a sign of confidence about economic growth. The Russell 2000 rose 40.63 points, or 2%, to 2,030.77. Energy stocks were the only laggard. U.S. crude oil prices fell 5.2% and natural gas prices slumped 8.2%. Wall Street is increasingly focusing on the latest round of corporate report cards as more big companies release their earnings. Signature Bank jumped 8.1% after beating analysts' expectations. Dental products maker Dentsply Sirona slumped 13.4% after firing its chief executive without giving a reason, along with issuing a profit forecast for the current quarter that was far below analysts estimates. Netflix sank 25% in after-hours trading after the video streaming giant reported its first loss in worldwide subscribers in more than a decade. Netflix said it was bracing for things to get even worse with a projected loss of an additional 2 million subscribers during the April-June period. As of Tuesday's close, Netflix had already lost half its value since hitting an all-time high in November. Railroad giant CSX will report earnings on Wednesday, along with Tesla. American Airlines and Union Pacific will report their results on Thursday. The latest round of earnings comes as investors try to gauge how companies and consumers are dealing with rising inflation that has made everything from food to clothing to gas more expensive. The conflict in Ukraine has added to those price pressures. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday downgraded the outlook for the world economy this year and next, blaming Russias war in Ukraine for disrupting global commerce, pushing up oil prices, threatening food supplies and increasing uncertainty already heightened by the coronavirus and its variants. Rising prices have prompted the Federal Reserve and other central banks to raise interest rates in order to help temper the effect of inflation. The Fed has already announced a quarter-percentage point rate hike and Wall Street expects a half-percentage rate increase at its next meeting. Currently, investors expect the rising rate to push the benchmark interest rate between 2.5% and 2.75% by the end of the year, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. It's going to be interesting to see how fast they hike rates from one meeting to the other, said Shawn Cruz, head trading strategist at TD Ameritrade. How we get to the end of the year is going to be something that will have a lingering effect of driving uncertainty in the market and continuing to drive volatility. Bond yields have been rising as Wall Street prepares for higher interest rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury is the highest it's been since late in 2018. Rising yields have also been raising pressure on an already tight housing market as mortgages rates rise and make borrowing more expensive. Wall Street will get more details on that outcome when the National Assn. of Realtors releases its home sales report for March on Wednesday.",

It earned him a $50,000 fine from the league on Tuesday.\nIrving, who had a game-high 39 points, defended his actions afterward saying fans crossed the line with obscenities directed at him. Teammate Kevin Durant said Tuesday that the team has no issue with how Irving reacted.\nAdvertisement\nKyries reaction was his reaction. We all stood behind that. I feel him  exactly what he said, Durant said. The same energy theyre giving off to him hes gonna give it right back. He played that way. I think its all in the game. They come for their experience of watching the game and might have to get something back from one of the players if you say something. Thats just the nature of the beast now.\nIt overshadowed a game in which Boston was able contain both Irving and Durant for most of the showdown.\nOne of the architects of that pressure, point guard Marcus Smart, was named defensive player of the year on Monday\nBoston coach Ime Udoka said Smart getting the award feels like an honor for the entire team, which entered the postseason with the NBAs top defensive rating.\nIts a great honor for us, Udoka said. I think everyone relishes the fact that hes being recognized for what hes done his whole career and the team is, obviously, No. 1 which reflects well on him.\nAdvertisement\nHere is a look at Wednesday nights games:\nNETS AT CELTICS\nCeltics lead 1-0. Game 2, 7:30 p.m. EDT, ESPN\nNEED TO KNOW: The Celtics pulled out a 115-114 win on Tatums buzzer-beating layup. It helped Boston survive after surrendering a 15-point lead in the second half. Boston played great defense, but Irving got loose late, scoring 18 points in the fourth quarter.\nKEEP AN EYE ON: The crowd and its effect on Irving, who nearly had the last word in Game 1. But his comments after the series opener will almost certainly ratchet up the level of disdain he hears from Celtics fans going forward.\nINJURY WATCH: Nets point guard Ben Simmons is continuing to go through more basketball-related activity as he recovers from the back issues that have delayed his debut since being traded from Philadelphia. But theres still no clarity on when, or if, he will play in this series. Coach Steve Nash said Monday was his first day of going through some contact drills with teammates. Hes making progress, but theres no real update, Nash said. Well just see how he responds and see if hes able to do more contact tomorrow.\nAdvertisement\nPRESSURE IS ON: Durant. Boston showed the All-Star various looks in Game 1, contributing to him shooting just 9 of 24 from the field, with four turnovers. He managed 23 points, but he will have to be more efficient if the Nets hope to even the series.\nBULLS AT BUCKS\nMilwaukee leads 1-0. Game 2, 9:30 p.m. EDT, TNT\nNEED TO KNOW: The Bucks have won 17 of their last 18 matchups with the Bulls, including a 93-86 Game 1 victory on Sunday. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 27 points  but none in the fourth quarter  and 16 rebounds as the Bucks won the opening game despite blowing an early 16-point lead. The Bucks didnt pull ahead for good until 5:03 remained in the game. The Bulls posted the lowest single-game point total of any Bucks opponent all season, shot a season-low 32.3% and went 7 of 37 from 3-point range. The Bucks won despite committing 21 turnovers.\nAdvertisement\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Bucks forward Khris Middleton. His career playoff production has been up and down, but the three-time All-Star was dominant at times during the Bucks 2021 title run. After shooting 4 of 13 and committing seven turnovers in Game 1, Middleton is due for a bounce-back performance.\nINJURY WATCH: Bucks reserve guard George Hill (abdominal strain) and forward Jordan Nwora (back soreness) missed Game 1. Jevon Carter filled Hills spot in the rotation and scored three points in 10 minutes.\nPRESSURE IS ON: Chicagos DeMar DeRozan, Zach LaVine and Nikola Vucevic. The Bulls top three players combined for 60 points but shot 29.6% (21 of 71) in Game 1. They were a combined 4 of 22 on 3-point attempts., with LaVine and Vucevic each going 2 of 10 from beyond the arc. They must shoot better. DeRozan vows that they will. I guarantee you that me, Zach and Vooch arent going to miss that many shots again, DeRozan said after Game 1.\nAdvertisement\n76ERS AT TORONTO\n76ers lead 2-0. Game 3, 8 p.m. EDT, NBATV\nNEED TO KNOW: Raptors coach Nick Nurse has worked the officials all series, trying to get them to call more fouls on the 76ers. So far, Joel Embiid has taken advantage of his time at the free-throw line. He made 12 of 14 free throws in Game 2. The Raptors only made 10 of 12 as a team. The Sixers took a total of 30 free throws in Game 2.\nKEEP AN EYE ON: Off the court, will 76ers super fan Meek Mill reignite his beef with Drake? On the court, the 76ers have gotten quiet production from Tobias Harris. Embiid and Tyrese Maxey stole the show the first two games. But Harris has 46 points and 16 rebounds through two games and steadied the Sixers with big shots when the Raptors seemed to close to making a run. He also had a playoff career-high three blocks in Game 2. Im in a great rhythm, great groove right now, he said.\nAdvertisement\nINJURY WATCH: The Raptors are banged-up. Raptors forward Scottie Barnes sat out Game 2 with a sprained left ankle and needed a walking boot. Gary Trent Jr. has a non-COVID illness and did not play in the second half. The Sixers will play the next two games without defensive ace Matisse Thybulle. Thybulle is barred from entering Canada because he is not fully vaccinated.\nPRESSURE IS ON: Toronto. Yes, the Raptors are headed home. But the 76ers have won 18 of 19 playoff series in franchise history when up 2-0.\n___\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\nComment",

      "body": "April 18, 2022\nDemocrats frustration around gun violence prevention is not new.\nAfter the Sandy Hook shooting, President Barack Obama tried and failed to convince Congress to enact popular gun safety measures like universal background checks and an assault weapon ban.\nTheres little sign now that the Democrats who control Congress will send gun safety measures to Bidens desk anytime soon.\nThe House passed legislation last year to expand background checks to include private and online sales, including at gun shows. But Senate Democratic leaders havent yet scheduled their version of the legislation for a vote. And facing near-unanimous GOP opposition, Democrats would need support from at least 10 Republicans in a 50-50 Senate to overcome any filibuster.\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., tried to bring the background check bill up for a Senate vote in December, but that effort failed when Republicans objected. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia also opposes the House bill.\nAsked whether Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer would bring gun safety legislation up for a vote, an aide pointed to comments the New York Democrat made in February.\nSen. Murphy had been trying to work with Republicans to get 60 votes. He hasnt given up on those efforts, although theyve not gotten that far. But were going to keep pursuing background checks. I believe in that very, very strongly, Schumer said at the time.\nIn the meantime, more Americans are dying from gun-related injuries than ever before.\nIn 2020, the most recent year for which federal data is available, 19,384 people were killed in gun homicides  a 35% increase from the previous year and the largest one-year increase in gun homicides on record.\nAdvertisement:\nRepublicans have overwhelmingly opposed gun control measures, casting any tightening of current law as a threat to the constitutionally protected right to bear arms. The GOP has instead called for stronger policing and more gun ownership to combat the crime surge.\nAt the same time, Republicans have seized on the spike in violent crime under the broad umbrella of public safety as a wedge issue to reshape how voters view gun violence. Republicans did well across Virginia, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in last falls off-year elections with public safety as one of their primary talking points.\nAnd the gun lobby is convinced that public safety concerns will help its Republican allies retake the House, if not the Senate, this fall.\nWe see a lot of opportunity heading into the midterms, said National Rifle Association spokesperson Andrew Arulanandam. Whether the gun control lobby realizes it or not, theres an increased appreciation and realization in this country that gun control does not make people safer.\nThe NRA has already celebrated sweeping successes at the state level in its push to allow people to carry concealed weapons without a license. Republican lawmakers in nine states enacted such laws since Democrats came to power in Washington in 2021. Overall, 25 states no longer require gun owners to have a permit to carry a concealed weapon in public.\nGuns remain an incredibly divisive issue in American politics, though polling suggests the issue has been overshadowed over the last year by other events.\nIn an AP-NORC poll last December, 24% named gun laws in an open-ended question as one of five top issues for the government to work on in 2022. That ranked below other issues, like the economy, COVID-19 and even immigration, but the percentage prioritizing gun laws for 2022 grew from 5% for 2021 and 12% for 2020. The poll was conducted the weekend after a shooting at Oxford High School in Michigan killed four and injured seven.\nAdvertisement:\nForty-one percent of Democrats named gun laws as a government priority in 2022, compared to just 6% of Republicans.\nMeanwhile, gun safety groups like March For Our Livesare ratcheting up pressure on Democrats to take action. The group for the first time is backing primary challenges this spring and summer to Democratic incumbents who havent prioritized the issue.\nWhile Senator Schumer and the rest of Congress are on holiday break, gun violence is not.\nWere outside Schumers NYC office RIGHT NOW demanding he bring Background Checks to a vote.",

The new Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics launched Tuesday. Its leaders say predicting the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. has been hampered by data-collection problems. In contrast, the United Kingdom uses regular population sampling with swab tests and blood draws to get a clearer picture of who's been infected, said Marc Lipsitch, the new centers science director. He said similar sampling should be considered in the U.S. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention needs to have better access to data from state governments and hospitals, said Caitlin Rivers, the center's associate director. CDC has been granted temporary authority for COVID-19 data collection, but the agency broadly relies on voluntary reporting and complex data agreements with states, Rivers said. The center is housed at the CDC. Its initial $200 million in funding came from the 2021 coronavirus relief package. The center has awarded $21 million to academic institutions to develop modeling and forecasting methods.",

      "body": "7:00 a.m. EDT\nLoading...\nA courier for the food delivery service Yandex Eda, operated by Yandex, on the job in Moscow. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg)\nPlaceholder while article actions load\nWhen the Kremlin wanted to compete with the West economically and in the contest for skilled workers more than a decade ago, its well-educated officials helped nurture homegrown answers to Google, Facebook and tech-security companies such as Symantec.\nArrowRight\nThe top Russian search engine, Yandex, sold shares on Nasdaq. The big social network VKontakte got a major investment from an oligarchs company as that firm sold stock, and the antivirus maker Kaspersky Lab expanded rapidly in other countries to become one of the best-known Russian exports.\nBut the very success of those companies unnerved top bureaucrats, who worried that such thriving Internet businesses would allow a new generation of Russians to glean uncensored information from around the world and to organize political movements beyond the governments control.\nAdvertisement\nThe resulting onslaught of laws, regulations and back-channel demands that the Kremlin imposed has reduced those once-promising tech giants to shadows of what they could have been  while wrecking what the companies founders had hoped would be hedges against government domination.\nThis has been a total disaster for the Russian economy, and the tech industry was adding a lot of value, said Esther Dyson, an American and early investor in Yandex who left the search engines board shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Even before they started waging war on Ukraine, they were waging war on the truth.\nRussian-language Yandex, which draws 4 billion visits a month and remains the most visited website in Russia, is the clearest example of Russian techs downfall. The majority of its stock is held by Western or global institutions and its headquarters is in the Netherlands, but neither fact has been enough to keep it from having to bend to Kremlin demands that it block search results for opposition leader Alexei Navalny or\ncensor news about the war\nin Ukraine.\nYandexs slow collapse, detailed here for the first time, shows how even the most advanced companies couldnt be safe with their core operations in Russia, underscoring why entrepreneurs and investors predict that it will be years, if not decades, before theyll be willing to reengage there again.\nAdvertisement\nEven if the stock is elsewhere, even if they have a foreign board of directors, it does nothing, said Ilya Ponomarev, a well-connected Russian technology entrepreneur and investor who fled to Ukraine in 2014 after casting the lone vote in Russias lower house\nagainst the annexation of Ukraines Crimean Peninsula.\nThey cannot escape, because they are irrevocably linked to a Russian audience.\nYandex was founded by Arkady Volozh, who is its chief executive, and the late Ilya Segalovich, who was its chief technology officer. The companys name is a contraction of Yet Another Index. Both founders admired the success of Yahoo.\nWhen the company sold shares on Nasdaq in 2011, Yandexs executives knew the Russian government would be sensitive about control slipping across its borders. So the founders kept shares with a majority of the vote, and Yandex issued one special share, held for years by a government bank, that could veto any one shareholders amassing more than 25 percent of the regular stock.\nPutins prewar moves against U.S. tech giants laid groundwork for crackdown on free expression\nStill, Yandex executives found themselves bargaining directly with regulators and overseers in the office of President Vladimir Putin, arguing that publicly traded stock was the key to retaining talent that would otherwise move abroad and that excessive restrictions would drive users to Western competitors, according to participants and those advised of the talks as they happened.\nAdvertisement\nThe industry was doing well, Dyson recalls of those years.\nPrivately, the executives hoped that the logic they presented would get them real freedom to operate, and for many years, it seemed that it did. But as the companies grew more important, Kremlin officials supported laws banning sites, directing others not to link to those sites and, in 2017, requiring that any media carried by major aggregation sites, including Yandexs, be licensed by the Russian government\n.\nSome companies paid an earlier price for becoming important. The early victims included VKontakte, Russias biggest social networking site, which operates much like Facebook. From humble beginnings among university students, VKontakte grew with general Internet use in Russia and became the most popular social site in 2008.\nThe Russian-government-friendly Internet conglomerate Mail.ru took an early stake and in turn sold a minority stake of itself to the public in London in 2010. Mail.ru was controlled by billionaire oligarch Alisher Usmanov, who was sanctioned this year by the United States. But VKontakte founder Pavel Durov held voting control until 2014, when he sold shares to a Mail.ru ally.\nMonths later, he was forced out of the company. In a post on his VKontakte account, Durov said the FSB, Russias federal security agency, forced him to sell after he refused to turn over personal information on members of a group supporting Ukrainian protests against Russian-allied President Viktor Yanukovych before his 2014 resignation.\nAdvertisement\nThe Kremlin won more direct control\nof VKontakte this past December when voting control went to affiliates of the state-controlled energy company Gazprom. After the passage of a law in March allowing sentences of up to 15 years in prison for describing Russias actions in Ukraine as a war, the site now heavily censors posts about the invasion.\nKaspersky Lab, the security firm that became one of the most globally recognized Russian technology companies, had planned to go public but dropped the idea in 2012. Instead, it pursued a major business expansion in other countries, giving it brand recognition and an argument that it should not do anything that cost it trust in the United States and elsewhere, employees said.\nBut that was less leverage than it needed when laws required tech companies to hand over data to the government on demand.\nAdvertisement\nConsumer security software typically has a great deal of power to act inside customer machines, and U.S. officials had been concerned for years that Kaspersky was seeking sensitive U.S. documents. In\n2017, the Department of Homeland Security\nordered federal agencies\nto remove Kaspersky software from their networks. That same year, Kaspersky admitted that its antivirus software had uploaded classified information from a U.S. intelligence workers home computer, although the company said it soon destroyed the information.\nBut Russian intelligence agencies had already made clear who was in charge when they charged Kaspersky cybercrime investigator Ruslan Stoyanov with treason in 2016 after he shared information with U.",

He said it was an important authority the Department will continue to work to preserve.\nAdvertisement:\nAdvertisement:\nColey said the CDC had said it would continue to assess public health conditions, and if the agency determined a mandate was necessary for public health, the Justice Department would file an appeal.\nAs of Tuesday, the agency hadnt made a determination, officials said.\nThe federal judges ruling did away with the last major vestige of federal pandemic rules and led to a mishmash of new locally created rules that reflected the nations ongoing divisions over how to battle the virus.\nMajor airlines and airports in places like Dallas, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Salt Lake City quickly switched to a mask-optional policy. Los Angeles County dropped its mandate for mass transit and a train conductor in New Jersey told commuters of their masks Tuesday: Feel free to burn them at will.\nNew York City, Chicago and Connecticut, however, continued to require masks for travelers.\nThe ride-sharing companies Lyft and Uber announced on their websites Tuesday that masks will now be optional while riding or driving.\nEven Walt Disney World in Florida on Tuesday announced it was lifting its mask requirement for its monorail, buses and sky gondola.\nFor many, the news was welcome. A video showed some passengers on a Delta Air Lines flight cheering and applauding as they removed masks upon hearing the announcement they were now optional. One man happily twirled his mask on his finger.\nHowever Brooke Tansley, a television producer and former Broadway performer, was incensed after boarding a flight with her 4-year-old and 8-month-old baby neither old enough to be vaccinated  only to learn the mask mandate had ended mid-flight.\nVery very angry about this, she said in a tweet, noting her baby was too young to wear a mask.\nPresident Joe Biden went all-in on flexibility Tuesday when asked if Americans should mask up on planes.\nThats up to them, Biden declared during a visit to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. But the White House continues to require face coverings for those traveling with him on Air Force One, citing CDC guidance.\nIn Portland, Oregon, transit employees immediately began taking down mask required announcements and signs, but said it would likely take several days to remove everything.\nThe city joined Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Kansas City, Missouri, and two of Alaskas largest cities, Anchorage and Juneau, in making masking optional on mass transit.\nSome passengers at Chicagos Union Station said the rules were confusing. Amtrak dropped its requirement. The Chicago Transit Authority and Metra, the regional commuter rail service, kept the requirement at first but dropped it late Tuesday.\nIts like this patchwork of different rules and enforcement of it, said Erik Abderhalden, who wore a mask as he waited for a Metra train to his home in suburban Naperville. I mean, its like Swiss cheese  theres no uniformity and it seems pretty laissez-faire.\nSubway rider Cooper Klinges was pleased that New York Citys public transit system wasnt following the trend and planned to keep its mask requirement in place. As he waited at a Brooklyn train station, he said he canceled a flight earlier this year over concerns about the virus.\nI dont think we are out of the woods yet, said Klinges, a teacher, citing concerns about the BA.2 omicron subvariant of the coronavirus. It is still around. We have to still stick it out.\nThe CDC had recently extended the mask mandate, which was set to expire Monday, until May 3 to allow more time to study the subvariant, which is now responsible for the vast majority of U.S. cases. But the court ruling puts that decision on hold.\nAfter a winter surge fueled by the omicron variant that prompted record hospitalizations, the U.S. has seen a significant drop in virus spread in recent months that led most states and cities to drop mask mandates.\nBut several Northeast cities have seen a rise in hospitalizations in recent weeks, leading Philadelphia to bring back its mask mandate.\nHollingsworth reported from Mission, Kansas, and Crawford from Chicago.

      "body": "ArrowRight\nBut over the past few weeks, he has authorized a historically large release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, resumed selling leases to drill on federal land and announced he is waiving an environmental restriction to allow summer sales of ethanol-based gasoline  all moves that are anathema to climate activists.\nSome advocates are increasingly frustrated over the discordant approach, arguing that Biden is sacrificing some of his long-term goal of combating climate change  and a presidential legacy of helping steer the nation away from fossil fuels  in exchange for the short-term aim of lowering prices at the pump.\nAdvertisement\nBeyond that, some contend the moves will barely affect gas prices.\nThe administration is in a tough place, but none of those moves are going to do much in the short term to reduce prices  and they will have a long-term impact on our climate, said Bill McKibben, the author and environmentalist who co-founded 350.org, a global grass-roots climate group. It would be a lot better for our climate, and a lot smarter politically, if Biden clearly placed the blame for prices where it really rests  on Big Oil  and used this moment to help the country break free from fossil fuels.\nThe collision between lofty aspirations and political pressures comes to a head Friday when Biden visits Seattle to celebrate Earth Day, where he probably will be joined by Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee, who has built his political career on fighting climate change. Protesters are expected to rally in front of the White House on Saturday to demand that Congress pass new climate legislation.\nAdvertisement\nBidens supporters say the focus on gas prices and helping Europe through an energy crisis has made it harder for the administration to tout the steps it has taken to protect the environment, including new rules cracking down on greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks and policies to cut methane emissions from oil and gas operations across the United States.\nOn Tuesday, the White House announced it is reversing former president Donald Trumps action weakening a landmark environmental law on the construction of pipelines, highways and other projects. The new rule will restore a requirement that federal agencies scrutinize the climate impact of major infrastructure projects.\nAdministration officials say the recent maneuvers to increase the fuel supply are meant to address the immediate price shocks created by the Russian President Vladimir Putins invasion of Ukraine and the inflationary pressure that preceded it. They remain committed, they say, to combating climate change and reducing the nations reliance on fossil fuels over the long term.\nAdvertisement\nIn an interview Tuesday, Ali Zaidi, the deputy White House national climate adviser, pushed back on the notion that the administration had shifted its approach to climate change. The presidents commitment and his policy positions on these key issues have been unwavering and unchanged, Zaidi said.\nBut Biden also recognizes that people need help in the short term, he added. His policy has always been to meet folks where they are, Zaidi said. And what that means in this context is addressing the emergency challenges precipitated by Putins aggression, while literally at the same time doing everything we can to accelerate the affordability and accessibility of technologies and tools that will help the American people achieve lasting energy security.\nYet there is little doubt that recent days have produced the jarring image of a president who vowed to curb reliance on oil and gas instead trying to find fresh ways to increase its supply.\nAdvertisement\nHes in a pickle, said Samantha Gross, a fellow specializing in climate and energy at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank. His arguments have had to change because of the changing conditions, and the situation has gotten a lot harder for him politically.  The politics were always going to be hard for him, but the level of difficulty just went way up. Its a tough hand to play.\nJamal Raad, executive director of Evergreen Action, a climate advocacy group, said the Biden administration  and the climate community  are in the midst of a fundamental shift in how they present their case to the public. They have long emphasized the jobs to be created by a green economy, he said, but in response to soaring inflation and a war in Ukraine, they are now emphasizing the savings Americans would see in a system less reliant on fossil fuels.\nIts a whole different world as far as communicating around clean energy and climate, Raad said. Its about lowering gas prices, and its about stopping petrol dictators like Vladimir Putin.\nAdvertisement\nClimate activists are also pushing the Senate to approve a House-passed bill that includes $555 billion in clean energy investments, which has stalled because of opposition from Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.). That is far more important than the concerns over Bidens recent moves to ramp up oil supply, they say.\nThat is the ballgame  the rest of this is small potatoes compared to that, Raad said. I think that is where most of the frustration should lie, rather than some of these short-term announcements.\nSome environmental groups are urging patience with the administrations attempts to bring down gas prices, saying Biden needs to address political reality in an effort to offset potential losses in the midterm elections that could derail the Democrats sweeping plans on climate.\nIf some of the short-term steps theyre taking to alleviate the pain Americans are feeling at the pump and how theyre feeling squeezed are the price we have to pay to get 50 votes in the U.S. Senate for a transformative clean energy deal, I think its a price worth paying, said David Kieve, president of EDF Action, the advocacy arm of the Environmental Defense Fund.\nAdvertisement\nIn the 15 months since Biden took office, the administration had largely focused on convincing Americans that the United States needs to pivot away from oil, gas and coal.\nBiden campaigned on a pledge to reach net-zero emissions in the United States by 2050, a goal more ambitious than that of former president Barack Obama. Biden envisioned eliminating fossil fuels from the electricity sector by 2035 and increasing renewable energy production on federal lands and waters.\nFrom inside a newly created White House Climate Policy Office, national climate adviser Gina McCarthy branded the administrations climate agenda as a form of economic stimulus that would create millions of jobs building solar farms, wind turbines and battery storage. Even as the administrations climate policies stalled in Congress and were threatened by the Supreme Court, Biden continued to make it a centerpiece of his agenda.\nAdvertisement\nThis week, the Biden administration said it will spend $6 billion to keep threatened nuclear power plants open, since they provide energy without contributing to climate change.\nBut",

He's on to something here. Any international relations graduate student could sketch out a serviceable, even pragmatic, rationale for any irredentist claim a nation might make against a neighbor. Conflict is not abhorrent. Genocide is. The secret sauce in this war  and perhaps all wars of conquest  is the quiescence of a citizenry, first in the mission itself, and then in what inevitably becomes justification of flagrantly disproportionate means in pursuit of elusive ends. Popular support for brazen aggression is usually manufactured by asserting a religious claim or an animating mythic idea. Wars of annexation, dehumanizing labor systems and even ethnic cleansing have all been given godly sanction. We would all be wise to consider Adam Smith's admonition: \"Virtue is more to be feared than vice, because its excesses are not subject to the regulation of conscience.\" David DiLeo, San Clemente The writer is a professor emeritus of history and humanities at Saddleback College. .. To the editor: Balmer should know that his statement, \"Those who claim to be Christians have been complicit in violence and evil,\" is a \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy. As an Episcopal priest, he should also know that anyone who claims to be a Christian is a Christian, regardless of their behavior. Simply put, this \"appeal to purity\" is an insidious cop-out, shirking collective responsibility by questioning the faithfulness of another of the same religion. Religiosity that is focused on the behavior of others instead of ourselves is doomed to sectarian dehumanization and tragic failure. The solution is to set a positive example by making mundane, common-sense arguments that overlap with one's religious convictions. Then, if we express our moral convictions based on the knowledge that our beliefs are strongly integrated with our emotional coherence, we are in a better position to examine the weaknesses in our own position, and thus more effectively address the positions of others.

      "description": "The L.A. Kings and other hockey teams see a chance to develop a fan base south of the border, with the hope of playing an NHL game in Mexico before long.",
      "body": "Ian Tarazonas black helmet is so big it looks like an upside-down satellite dish, and his oversized hockey sweater hangs to his knees. But dont let appearances fool you. Ian is a terror on the ice. At one point during a recent practice, Ian skated up to another player, pulled his stick back and cracked him over the head. And that player was a teammate. It didnt qualify as assault because Ian is only 3 years old and the player he whacked, who was unhurt, is 5. But it did serve as proof that it can be a challenge introducing little kids to any sport. And when the sport is hockey and the location is a shopping mall in Mexico City, that challenge only grows. Luis Gonzlez often has to suppress laughter while coaching four dozen kids, the oldest of which are 7. Obviously the little kids are harder because you just have to keep them focused, he said. In between coaching sessions, Gonzlez, who answers to Oso or \"Bear,\" a childhood nickname he cant fully explain, plays for Mexicos national ice hockey team. If you didnt know Mexico had a national ice hockey team, dont feel bad. Aside from the 22 players and their families, few others know either. But the sport is gaining a foothold, or at least a toehold, in Mexico. According to the Mexico Ice Hockey Federation  theres one of those too  2,690 players participate in the sport in Mexico, 1,600 of whom are junior players like the ones Gonzlez coaches. It's a small number  and certainly an underestimate  but it still has drawn the attention of several NHL teams, which see a chance to grow the game and develop a new fan base with the hope of playing an NHL game in Mexico in the near future. I dont see any reason for us to wait, Kings President Luc Robitaille said. Its more important for us to go out of our way and to make it available. Theres enough kids we know like to play. Many of them play at an ice rink tucked into a dark corner of a Mexico City shopping mall, between a Dairy Queen and a Carls Jr. and below a Sears. The Centro Santa Fe, Mexico's second-largest shopping mall, sprawls along a major boulevard in a tony neighborhood of skyscrapers and gated apartment buildings on the western edge of the capital. Roberto Arriaga, whose three boys all play hockey, makes the three-hour round trip there from Toluca as many as five nights a week, spending almost as much time in the chilly bleachers overlooking the ice as he does running his business in aftermarket car sales. A lot of friends tell me that Im crazy, said Arriaga, who discovered hockey almost by accident. After introducing his eldest son, Beto, to more traditional sports such as soccer without success, on a whim he put the boy in skates and hockey gear at age 6. Nine years later, Beto is still playing, as are brothers Mateo, a speedy 12-year-old defenseman, and Paulo, a skinny 10-year-old goalie so small he can fit inside the net without having to duck his helmeted head. The two younger boys say they want to play in the NHL someday, something no Mexican has done. Arriaga chuckles when he hears that. At that age, he said its very good to have a dream. That dream isnt what motivates the four coaches at the rink, who work with more than 140 players in six divisions, ranging in age from 3 years old through high school. Nor is producing professional players what has led the Kings to partner with the rink, offering in-person and virtual clinics as well as material assistance. Banners touting the relationship with the L.A. team hang throughout the mall while many of the tiny players take the ice wearing black or gray Kings sweaters with a Mexican flag sewn on one shoulder. The goal, the Kings insist, is simply to introduce the kids to hockey, teach them how to play (and sometimes to even skate) and to fuel a passion for the sport. Its just a totally different vibe over there, said Derek Armstrong, who spent six seasons playing for the Kings and is now the teams community and hockey development specialist. \"We want to bring hockey to Mexico, but we also want them to embrace it themselves and put their own little twist on it, their own little culture on it. That seems to be taking hold at the Santa Fe rink, where rushes up and down the ice take place at breakneck speed, with few passes and even fewer checks  physical defensive moves intended to disrupt play. In that way, Mexican hockey can sometimes look like soccer on skates. Instructions and encouragement  vmonos! vmonos! dle! dle!  ring out in Spanish, although most of the hockey terms, like stick and puck, go untranslated. What the Kings want to create, then, is hockey with a Mexican accent and Latin sensibility. Theyre not looking to import a sport wholesale but rather to create a hybrid. What they want are players such as 15-year-old Paula Martnez, one of two girls in the bantam age group  and one 270 girls playing hockey nationwide, according to the federation. She started skating at 3 and has been playing hockey with boys almost as long, tucking as much of her long brown hair inside her helmet as she can, then letting the rest spill down to her shoulders. Her friends, she said, dont understand the game  or why she plays it. Every time you say you play hockey, theyre amazed. So you have to explain what it is. They think its only fighting, and its really not just that, Paula said, flipping through cellphone photos of a trip to the University of Wisconsin, where she skated with members of the schools womens team. If I had to choose a sport again, she said, I would still choose hockey. Many in Mexico dont have that choice. Cost and access to an ice rink are major obstacles to hockeys growth in Mexico. Players in Guillermo Dazs program at the Santa Fe rink pay a $125 annual registration fee and $146 a month for instruction and ice time. That doesnt include the brightly colored composite sticks, durable skates and other equipment such as pads and helmets, which can easily top $1,000 combined  more for goalies. Thats well beyond the reach of most families in a country where the typical salary hovers around $17,000 a year. And while Mexico City has four rinks, there are just 14 in the rest of the country, according to the national ice hockey federation. The level of play at the Santa Fe rink varies widely depending on the age group. On a recent Monday night, the peewees game, for kids 11 and 12, was so quick and well-played, dozens of shoppers stopped to peer down from the malls upper floors and watch. For the youngest players, meanwhile, simply staying upright and focused is the goal, which is why Daz spent most of an hourlong practice simply trying to herd his toddler students into a straight line. During one drill, the players, many of whom wore blue COVID facemasks beneath their helmets, set off after the puck only to forget what they were supposed to do with it once they got it. Kids pulled back their sticks, which were often bigger than they are, then shot at the wrong net, while others simply wandered",

      "body": "Meanwhile, Musk has been consumed in recent weeks with a surprise push to take over the social media platform he uses for company announcements and communicating with his more than 82 million followers.\nAdvertisement\nAnalysts and investors have expressed concern that Musk is stretched too thin  not only by the demands of Tesla, which has opened multiple new factories in recent weeks, but other responsibilities as CEO of rocket builder SpaceX and several smaller companies. If he succeeds in his bid to buy Twitter, Musk will have a historic, and largely unprecedented, catalogue of tech companies under his helm even after questioning last year how long he could keep up with overflowing demands.\nMusk and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Musk praised Teslas performance despite the challenges in a tweet this month.\nThis was an *exceptionally* difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions & China zero Covid policy, he wrote. Outstanding work by Tesla team & key suppliers saved the day.\nAdvertisement\nTesla said at the time that it delivered more than 300,000 vehicles in the quarter, the first of 2022, positioning its numbers as a strong result despite ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns.\nAnalysts expect Tesla to report strong first quarter numbers, but those will largely be a footnote as the company faces questions over how the China closure will affect its year. Tesla has called the Shanghai factory its main export hub, making it a critical site for the carmaker that is largely credited with ushering in the era of electric vehicles.\nOver the course of a decade, Tesla went from a niche automaker delivering tens of thousands of vehicles to more than 936,000 in 2021. Along the way, it has faced profitability concerns, regulatory fights and production challenges that posed massive hurdles for Musk.\nAdvertisement\nAlready Tesla buyers are waiting in some places for more than six months to get their new vehicles, analysts said.

He called the measures fascist and urged the government give people back their g--d--- freedom.\nGene Munster, managing partner with Loup Ventures, said Teslas China factory closure signaled potential further complications.\nAdvertisement\nThe bigger factor is: Is China adopting a different posture toward working with U.S. companies over the long haul? he asked.

About 250 structures remained threatened in the area, which is popular with hikers and off-road vehicle users and where astronauts have trained amid volcanic cinder pits.\nThe county declared an emergency after the wildfire ballooned from 100 acres Tuesday morning to over nine square miles by evening, and ash rained from the sky. The fire was moving northeast away from the more heavily populated areas of Flagstaff, home to Northern Arizona University, and toward Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, said Coconino National Forest spokesman Brady Smith.\nIts good in that its not headed toward a very populated area, and its headed toward less fuel, Smith said. But depending on the intensity of the fire, fire can still move across cinders.\nAdvertisement\nAuthorities wont be able to determine whether anyone was injured in the wildfire until the flames subside. Firefighters and law-enforcement officers went door to door telling people to evacuate but had to pull out to avoid getting boxed in, said Coconino County Sheriff Jim Driscoll.\nCalifornia\nPG&E to pay more than $55 million to avoid criminal prosecution for starting two wildfires\nPG&E Corp. has reached a deal with prosecutors over starting two major California wildfires and will avoid criminal prosecution.\nHe said his office got a call about a man who was trapped inside his house, but firefighters couldnt get to him.\nWe dont know if he made it out or not, Driscoll said.\nVarious organizations worked to set up shelters for evacuees and animals, including goats and horses.\nThe scene was all too familiar for residents who recalled rushing to pack their bags and flee a dozen years ago when a much larger wildfire burned in the same area.\nCalifornia\nClimate change is now the main driver of increasing wildfire weather, study finds\nNew study says climate change is essentially two-thirds to 88% responsible for the conditions driving wildfire woes in the western United States.\nThis time was different, right there in your backyard, said resident Kathy Vollmer.\nShe said she and her husband grabbed their three dogs but left a couple of cats behind as they faced what she described as a wall of fire.\nWe just hope they are going to be OK, she said.\nEarlier in the day, the wildfire shut down U.S. 89, the main route between Flagstaff and far northern Arizona, and communities on the Navajo Nation.

      "body": "Email\nAdvertisement:\nBill and Rudi Weissinger remain covid-cautious. Theyve had three shots of the Moderna coronavirusvaccine. They wear masks at the grocery store and avoid large gatherings. When Bill recently offered a friend a fist-bump rather than a handshake, the friend said, Oh, still? Yes is the answer, and most of their friends in Friday Harbor, Wash.  an island community  are similarly vigilant.\nAdvertisement:\nAdvertisement:\nAdvertisement:\nThe Weissingers want to get another booster shot. Theyre in their mid-70s and eligible. But they also plan to travel to France later this year. Boost now? Boost later?\nAdvertisement:\nAdvertisement:\nOur fear is if we get the booster now, it will have faded by then, Bill says.\nWe definitely believe in the boosters. We are not anti-vaxxers. Give me any shot you can, Rudi says.\nMost Americans arent trying to time their next booster for an overseas vacation, and many people in low-wage jobs and crowded multigenerational households are far more exposed than the Weissingers are. But their uncertainty about a fourth shot reflects the widespread confusion about boosters who exactly should get them, and when, and why  that has dogged the governments vaccination campaign.\nEven highly informed consumers of pandemic news may struggle to sift through the latest government guidance and newest scientific studies. And even at this stage in the crisis, they may be unclear on what additional boosters can and cant do.\nPublic health officials who authorized a second booster shot last monthfor people 50 and older and for immunocompromised people 12 and older have insisted its a stopgap, aimed primarily at keeping the most vulnerable people out of the hospital or the cemetery. A second booster appears to add to protection against severe illness in people 60 and older but offers only a modest, temporary shield against infection.\nThe booster issue reveals some tension between public health priorities and individual interests. The disease experts worry about epidemic waves that can overwhelm the health-care system. To a doctor, a vaccine has worked fine if it keeps a person out of the hospital, with just a mild to moderate case which can mean anything from a few sniffles to a miserable week in bed utterly flattened by the virus. Many people, though, dont want that bad week  with the attendant risk of long covid  and will do anything to keep it off their calendar.\nI think the expectations [from] the first performance of the vaccines is that it is possible to be completely protected against infection or any small cough even, Hanneke Schuitemaker, head of viral vaccine development and translational medicine at Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson, said at a recent forum held by the New York Academy of Sciences.\nThe reality is that a person who is up to date on vaccination is very unlikely to wind up in the hospital, although the virus may still be able to break through the initial line of immune defense and generate sickness.\nYou may have sort of a common cold, but your immune system will deal with it and prevent severe disease, Schuitemaker said.\nEven as many people rush to get a fourth shot, many others still havent received their third second or first. Despite clear evidence that a third shot can save lives and better protect people, more than 90 million eligible people in the United States havent rolled up their sleeves for their first booster. Booster uptake has been higher among white peoplethan in communities of color\nMedical advisers to the federal government have debated the necessity and ethics of a fourth shotgiven that there are higher public health priorities, including reaching unvaccinated communities and ensuring wider global access to vaccines. But in their late March authorization, federal agencies said people 50 and oldercould get an additional booster it they are at least four months past their previous shot.\nStrikingly, the agencies did not clearly recommend that booster for everyone who is eligible, and federal officials advice varies.\nRochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said people 65 and older and those 50 and older with underlying medical conditionsare most likely to benefit. Ashish Jha White House covid-19 response coordinator, told \nFox News Sunday\n the data were pretty compelling for people older than 60 to get a second booster. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on MSNBCthat people older than 50 should get a fourth shot.\nData from Israel, which offered fourth shots to people 60 and older during the omicron surge, show that the additional shot increases protection against severe illness and death compared with a third shot. But against infections  most of which are officially deemed mild  a fourth shot provided only a modest and brief increase in protection, peaking at four weeks after the booster dose and dropping back to the baseline after eight weeks.\n[T]hese findings suggest that protection against confirmed infection wanes quickly, the researchers concluded.\nI was shocked, said Robert M. Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. He said he thought the additional protection against infection from the fourth shot would mirror that of the third rather than be so brief.\nIf the fourth shot offers a relatively brief window of higher protection, he said, timing that booster according to plans  a wedding, a family reunion, visiting an elderly relative, a vacation  seems reasonable. But its not an easy calculation, he said, because there are so many factors in the equation.\nTheres no perfect plan. Youre weighing risks, benefits, uncertainties, your own personal circumstance, Wachter said. I do this for a living, and I get a headache when I try to think this through.\nRisk analysis is not the strong suit of most people. Guidance from the CDC about the risk of infection has not always been clarifying. The risk on any given day depends a great deal on the current level of community transmission, but that data may not be easily found or interpreted and could be out of date.\nAnd the virus itself is not a fixed entity. The omicron variant is more transmissible than earlier forms of the virus, and there is now a growing roster of omicron subvariants, including BA.2, which are more transmissible yet. As it mutates, the virus has become more evasive of the human immune system.\nThe result is that an individuals risk analysis  is it safe, on this day, with this level of community transmission of this latest omicron subvarianton the prowl, to dine indoors at a restaurant?  is thoroughly contaminated with guesswork, wishful thinking and/or fear.\nThere is no simple test of an individuals protection. There isnt a line in the sand  what experts call a correlate of immunity  that means someone is immune or not immune, or is or isnt likely to end up in a hospital bed.\nAntibodies may h",

      "description": "Welcome to the mask-optional phase of the pandemic. It brings freedoms and risks",
      "body": "A new mask-optional phase of the pandemic is arriving, sparking concern from some experts that the shift is occurring too soon. For months, local officials have been easing mask rules in public places, such as supermarkets and shopping malls. But a federal court ruling Monday striking down the federal mask-wearing order on public transportation systems accelerated the trend, with Uber, Lyft, many airlines and transit agencies making face coverings optional. In one section of Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday morning, an estimated 30% to 40% of travelers were not wearing masks. \"It's about time,\" tweeted Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Santa Clarita). But parents of young children who cannot get vaccinated and as well as advocates for people with compromised immune systems are alarmed. While new COVID-19 hospitalizations are at among their lowest levels nationally, cases are rising slowly  from 25,000 to 37,000 a day over the past two weeks. Nearly 400 people in the U.S. are dying of COVID-19 daily. It's unclear, for now, whether the lifting of the mask order on public transit will dramatically worsen the pandemic, given relatively high levels of immunity due to vaccinations and widespread infections of the Omicron variant over the winter. There has been some optimism that California and the U.S. can avoid a significant spring surge. While some European countries (such as Britain) have suffered a second big Omicron surge, others (such as Spain) have avoided one. But making masks optional too soon on transit could create more vulnerabilities if another variant comes along, or the latest Omicron subvariant circulating in New York ends up becoming particularly troublesome. \"It's just premature to have had it lifted,\" UCLA epidemiologist Dr. Robert Kim-Farley said of the ending of mask requirements on airlines, airports, buses and trains nationwide, which followed the order of Florida U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle in Tampa striking down the federal mask-wearing order on public transportation systems. The U.S. Department of Justice said it will appeal the the judge's order if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concludes a mask-wearing order for transportation is still needed for public health. The Justice Department said it believes the CDC has the authority to issue a mask-wearing order on public transit, which has been in effect for about 15 months. A previous directive, issued by the Transportation Security Administration at the CDC's recommendation, was initially expected to expire on Monday. Last week, the CDC said the mask order would continue so scientists could study the potential impact of rising coronavirus cases, and TSA extended mask-wearing rules through May 3. Scientists at the CDC \"had asked for 15 days to make a more data-driven durable decision,\" tweeted White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha, and \"we should have given it to them.\" President Biden, when asked by a reporter Tuesday if people should be wearing masks on planes, replied: \"That's up to them.\" The CDC and a number of public health experts have urged people to still wear masks on public transit, given the rise in transmission and the appearance of the Omicron subvariant BA.2.12.1  believed to be 25% more contagious than its parent subvariant, BA.2, which has dominated the nation. BA.2.12.1 now is estimated to make up 19% of cases nationwide, including more than half of the cases in the New York and New Jersey area. \"I really don't think it's a smart decision,\" said Yifang Zhu, an aerosol scientist and professor in the department of environmental health sciences at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, of lifting the mask requirement for transit. \"If someone has contracted COVID and the virus gets released into the cabin air ... it's going to be distributed across the whole cabin. There is no physical distancing that you can keep in such a confined environment,\" she said. Air filtration systems do help, but \"the air doesn't get immediately filtered out at the point that it gets out of people's mouths,\" Zhu said. Buses and subways, in turn, can be more or less risky depending on the air flow and how crowded they are, she said. Immunocompromised people and others worried about the virus can get some protection by wearing an N95 or KN95 mask, but masks are especially effective as a method of \"source control\"  a way to prevent someone who is contagious from spreading the virus, she said. If you had only one mask for two people  one infected, one not  you would want to give it to the infected person, Zhu said. \"It's better than nothing\" for vulnerable people to wear masks when others go without them, she said, but \"you are protecting others and the community as a whole if everybody just does a little extra effort.\" Immunocompromised people expressed alarm about the ruling. Already pushed to the background of many pandemic discussions, many now face an unenviable proposition: either risk traveling where many people won't wear a mask, or cancel much-anticipated plans to visit friends and family. Janet Handal, president and co-founder of the Transplant Recipients and Immunocompromised Patient Advocacy Group, had been planning to fly to see family in Texas she hadn't seen in more than a year. Now, \"I just don't know what I'm going to do,\" said Handal, a kidney transplant recipient who lives in New York City. She is unconvinced that researchers have adequately assessed whether wearing a mask will be enough to protect someone who is immunocompromised if others around them are going maskless. \"As a person who is immunocompromised, I feel that is discriminatory against me because it puts me at very high risk,\" she said of the court decision. \"I don't understand why we should have to live less of a life than anybody else.\" In the aftermath of the judge's ruling, the L.A. County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Metrolink and the L.A. Department of Transportation's downtown DASH and Commuter Express bus service are no longer requiring riders to wear face coverings. At Los Angeles International Airport, passengers were having to make their own choices about masking up. Terrence Littlefield, 35, traveling with United Airlines on Tuesday said he was happy that the choice of whether to mask was now up to travelers, though he would personally opt to mask during the flight. With the spike right now, I think people should take it into their own hands and be conscientious about how you feel and gauge how comfortable you feel, he said. Yazmin Quirino, 35, who works for special services at LAX, said her husband is diabetic and she will continue wearing a mask regardless of the airports announcement yesterday.  I know there are still variants out there and I dont want to get my family sick, she said. For some, the decision is far more wrenching than a matter of convenience. Handal, of the Transplant Recipients and Immunocompromised Patient Advocacy Group, said that although airlines have touted their filtrat",

Tyler Herro scored 15 for Miami, while Max Strus scored 14 and Gabe Vincent added 11 for top-seeded Miami, which took a 2-0 lead over the eighth-seeded Hawks. Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 19 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter for Atlanta. Trae Young scored 25 for the Hawks, while DeAndre Hunter had 16 and John Collins finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds for the Hawks. Butlers previous playoff best was 40, done twice, both in the bubble when the Heat made the 2020 NBA Finals. The Heat needed all of his heroics then, and they needed them all on Tuesday as well. Bogdanovics 3-pointer with 3:15 left got Atlanta within 104-101. From there, it was all Butler. He had a dunk, a 3-pointer and another dunk  all in the span of 56 seconds  to turn things from in doubt to locked down, putting Miami up 10 with 1:20 remaining and ensuring the Heat would finish off the win. Just staying aggressive, Butler said. Taking what the defense gives me. As would be expected in a playoff series, pleasantries began being exchanged with more regularity. The first half featured 16 fouls by Atlanta and 14 by Miami  a season-high for the Hawks, one off the season-high for the Heat, and those 30 personals didnt even include a double technical that Lowry and Hunter got for getting face-to-face. Young picked up a technical for arguing a foul against him late in the third as well, the capper to a period where the Heat went from barely ahead to holders of a double-digit lead going into the final 12 minutes. He played the entire third quarter, but managed only two shots in that span  making both  and didnt get to the foul line, while committing five turnovers in that period alone. And in time, Miami hit its stride. Kevin Huerters stepback 3-pointer with 8:59 left in the third pulled Atlanta within 64-62. The Hawks went nearly three minutes without scoring again, and the game looked very different after those three minutes. The Heat went 4 for 4 in that stretch  3-pointers by Butler, P.J. Tucker and Strus, with a layup by Butler in there as well  and it added up to an 11-0 run that pushed the lead out to 75-62. The margin remained at least eight points for the next 11 minutes, before Atlanta began clawing back. Young hit Collins with a strike for a layup, and Bogdanovics long jumper got Atlanta within 94-90 midway through the fourth. But the Hawks never got the lead. Butler saw to that.",

      "body": "\"Fantastic Beasts\" and \"The Flash\" star Ezra Miller was arrested again in Hawaii on Tuesday after allegedly throwing a chair at a woman's head. The actor was taken into custody at 1:30 a.m. for second-degree assault following an incident at a home in Phoa on the Big Island of Hawaii, according to a media release from the Hawaii Police Department. Miller, who is nonbinary, was identified as a 29-year-old visitor from Vermont and was arrested after being located during a traffic stop nearby. Patrol officers responded to a report of an assault at 1:10 a.m. that occurred at a get-together at a private residence in the Leilani Estates subdivision in lower Puna, authorities said. \"During the course of their investigation, police determined that the individual, later identified as Ezra Miller, became irate after being asked to leave and reportedly threw a chair, striking a 26-year-old female on the forehead, resulting in an approximate half-inch cut,\" the release said. The victim refused treatment for her injury. \"After conferring with the County Prosecutors Office, at 4:05 a.m. on Tuesday morning Miller was released pending further investigation. This is an active investigation,\" the statement continued. Miller's new mug shot was posted online Tuesday on the police department's website. Millers lawyer, Francis Alcain, did not immediately respond Tuesday to The Times' request for comment. The \"Justice League\" star has had a number of run-ins with the law during their time in Hawaii. Miller is facing charges in a separate case involving a traffic violation in Hilo and another case that allegedly took place at a karaoke bar. Police had been called to a dispute in downtown Hilo on March 19 where Miller was allegedly uncooperative and refused to leave the area and continued to obstruct the sidewalk, Hawaii Police Department Asst. Chief Kenneth Quiocho told the Associated Press. Miller was cited for obstructing a highway. In the karaoke-bar incident on March 28, Miller allegedly became agitated when people at a Margarita Village bar began singing karaoke. Miller allegedly yelled obscenities and at one point grabbed the microphone from a young woman who was singing. Miller later lunged at a man who was playing darts, according to the Hawaii Police Department. Miller was briefly taken into custody and released on $500 bail. Last week, a judge dismissed a temporary restraining order against the actor that was requested by a Hawaii couple at the couple's request, scrubbing one of a handful of criminal proceedings that The Flash star has been involved in as of late. In that case, Miller was accused of harassment and theft after allegedly barging into the couple's bedroom and threatening them at a hostel in Hilo, the same Big Island town where the actor was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and harassment in one of the March incidents. Their attorney requested last week that a hearing be postponed to April 26 because Miller and prosecutors are in what Alcain described as pre-negotiations for an agreement on the two outstanding cases. Hawaii News Now reported that Miller is scheduled to be in court Tuesday to enter a plea on the harassment and disorderly conduct charges.",

(Alyssa Pointer/Reuters)\nPlaceholder while article actions load\nIt is telling, isnt it, that the Biden administration did not immediately commit to filing an emergency appeal after a federal judge in Florida overturned the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions mask mandate for travel settings?\nArrowRight\nInstead, the administration has said it is in the process of deciding whether it will try to stop the order from U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle from going into effect.\nThats bureaucratese for we dont feel too strongly about this. I suspect some in the Biden administration have come to the same conclusion that much of the country has reached: It is time for indoor mask mandates to end. They had to end sometime, after all, and if not now, when?\nWhen people stop dying! says a voice from the back. But that ceased to be a workable answer last summer when it became clear that the vaccines were not providing the sterilizing immunity that might have allowed us to eliminate the virus, the way we have done with smallpox and polio. Anything short of that requires us to figure out how to live with a virus that will continue to circulate. And by live, I mean full, normal lives, not the severely restricted public activities of the past couple of  years.\nAdvertisement\nSuch measures were acceptable as temporary delaying tactics to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed. They bought doctors time to figure out how to treat the virus and gave scientists the precious months they needed to develop vaccines and treatments. Before those vaccines and treatments arrived, I was a strong advocate of stringent social distancing, and once the vaccines became available, I supported making them mandatory. Liberty is precious, but it does not include the right to spread deadly viruses to other people.\nThe Post's View: Masks work. The judges ruling does not change that.\nBut now that we have vaccines and treatments, its time to reconsider the trade-offs we made. Policies that were appropriate when the infection fatality rate was 1 in 200 do not necessarily pass a cost-benefit test after vaccines and treatments have reduced those risks 20-fold, especially since further improvements will likely be somewhat slower and less dramatic.\nOne could argue, of course, that masks on planes still pass muster. Isnt the inconvenience small, compared with the catastrophic risks faced by people who cant get vaccinated, or whose immune systems are too compromised to mount a strong response to the vaccine?\nAdvertisement\nFair enough, but then one also has to ask about the other side of that cost-benefit equation: Exactly how many coronavirus cases are being prevented by requiring people to wear masks on planes? Airplanes are extremely well ventilated, which is why there have been so few outbreaks traced to air travel compared with other indoor environments. And while masks do offer some added protection against whatever risk remains, the cloth and surgical masks being worn by most people arent really all that effective  even before you consider how often they are pulled down to eat, or drink, or just gulp a little air.\nFollow\nFollow\nAdd\nThose masks also have costs for the people forced to wear them, as I recently found out when a series of badly timed connecting flights sent me sprinting through airports in my mask. (Or attempting to sprint; I missed my planes.) And while this is a minor consideration, some of the side effects of mask mandates are not; a relative with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cannot fly because it is too hard for them to breathe in a mask.\nHenry Olsen: The CDCs mask mandate for flights needed to go\nYet the largest cost may be to the already crumbling authority of public health institutions. As we have discovered, public health measures have to bear some relationship to what the public thinks is reasonable. Otherwise, no matter how sound their logic or scientific basis, they will fail because people will not comply. A nation resentfully wearing masks pulled down under its noses isnt doing anyone much good.\nAdvertisement\nMask mandates and the like were sold as temporary measures. Remember flatten the curve? Every time public health experts promised a short-term solution that turned into a long-term lifestyle change, their credibility took a hit. It cannot afford many more.\nPublic health works best when authorities are seen as assisting the public by making the same risk-reward calculations the public would, if only it had the time and expertise to sort through all the data. If authorities instead come to be seen as martinets, forcing the public to hew to their own extremely risk-averse preferences, they will meet fierce resistance the next time they urge us to adopt some costly measure.\nAs the experts keep warning us, there is likely to be another pandemic at some point. Our global economy makes a too-excellent superhighway for pathogens. We need to prepare for that next contagion by recognizing when its time to let go of the extraordinary measures we needed to fight the\nlast.",

      "body": "Copied!\nPrint\nLast week, the publisher of Bad and Boujee: Toward a Trap Feminist Theology pulled it  from distribution after critics raised  concerns about the white authors qualifications to write on the books  stated topics of the Black experience, hip-hop music, ethics, and feminism.\nAmong those critics was author Sesali Bowen, who coined the concept of trap feminism years ago. At its core was how people attempt to celebrate Black women without talking about their lived experiences. Things like copying the aesthetics of musicians such as Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion without giving them attribution or linking it to their lives.\nBowen says she wanted to emphasize these women\nbecause  they are often talked about without ever being talked to.\nSo she was taken aback when earlier this year, white academic Jennifer Buck released a theology book on trap feminism. While Bowen first introduced the concept of trap feminism nearly a decade ago, she said Buck did not approach her while researching Bad and Boujee. The idea of talking about Black women, but not directly engaging with them about their lived experiences, gets to the core of why Bowen first felt the need to label this era and concept of trap feminism.\nBowen coined the term in 2014, taking its name from a hip-hop genre that originated in the South. Trap is slang for a house where drugs are sold and the music  references street life, violence, poverty and many of the experiences Black people  face in the South.\nAdvertisement\nBuck is an associate professor of practical theology at Southern Californias Azusa Pacific University, a  private, evangelical Christian college. Her book features a Black woman on the cover and throughout references the lived experiences of Black women, according to the books online description. She did not respond to The Times requests for comment on the fallout.\nBowens 2021 book Bad Fat Black Girl: Notes from a Trap Feminist summarizes the niche topic\n: Trap feminism says that Black girls who have ever rocked bamboo earrings, dookie braids, Baby Phat, lace fronts, or those who have worked as hoes, scammers, call-center reps, at daycares, in retail, and those who sell waist trainers and mink lashes on Instagram are all worth the same dignity and respect we give Michelle Obama and Beyonc.\nBowen shared a recent exchange she had with Buck  over Instagram.\nAfter a few messages, Bowen wrote to Buck, I think more than anything I would like to know what brought you to this research, why you thought you were the best person to do it, and why its not in conversation with folks who have been doing trap feminist work for years?\nShe says she hasnt heard back.\nI think I was just shocked at the lack of awareness, if you will. I think it was just disheartening, Bowen told The Times about the whole ordeal.\nBowen has a masters degree in gender studies from Georgia State University; she\nunderstands the process of\nShe says if Buck\nhad Googled trap feminism,\nher work would have come up. Instead, Buck cited Bowens work in a footnote in her book.\nI think the fact that Jennifer Buck does not have the lived experience that makes her the person to write about trap feminism or Black feminism is honestly just the salt in the wound, Bowen said. Now were also dealing with issues around cultural appropriation, culture vulturing and just kind of like cultural voyeurism that is just icky, you know. Its just cringe and I hate that we are still doing this in 2022.\nIn a separate Instagram  exchange with Christian writer Jo Luehmann, Buck explained her research process.\nI did this research directly interviewing women running trap with a research team of primarily black women. Everyone was paid well  those who helped me conduct the research and those interviewed, Buck wrote. I will also add: I believe anti-racist work is the work of white people to do, which includes hiring and elevating black voices and all historically marginalized voices in doing theology.\nAuthor Chanequa Walker-Barnes joined a chorus of voices on\ndecrying Bucks approach\nto this topic within Black culture. One of Walker-Barnes first books was published by Wipf and Stock Publishers, a Christian publishing house, which also released Bad and Boujee this February.\nIts not that White scholars cant write about Black women, but it has to be done with extreme care, a whole lot of cultural sensitivity and humility, and in relationships of accountability with Black women, Walker-Barnes wrote on Twitter. And it would probably need a Black woman editor.\nWipf and Stock\nannounced on Friday that it would pull Bad and Boujee from distribution.\nWe humbly acknowledge that we failed Black women in particular, and we take full responsibility for the numerous failures of judgment that led to this moment, the publisher said in a statement. Our critics are right: we should have seen numerous red flags, including but not limited to the inappropriateness of a White theologian writing about the experience of Black women (the issue of cultural appropriation is pervasive, from cover to content), the lack of Black endorsers, and the apparent lack of relationship with Black scholars, especially those who originated the trap feminist discourse.\nBowen said Bucks silence is the least trap feminist approach to\nthis controversy.\nI want to call it kind of a psychological violence, if you will. Professor Buck starts this\nsstorm\nand then\nto just turn away from it, Bowen said. She has refused so far to engage in this conversation that she has started. Thats not what trap feminism is all about. Because a trap feminist can fight her battles, be accountable and hold people accountable.",
